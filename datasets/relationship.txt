Hey, it 12:26 am and i cant stop thinking about you. What if you don’t really love me? What if you’re with someone else that is prettier than me and you’re just playing with my feelings? What if your future plans are just all jokes? What if this whole thing is nothing to you? What if…? Please tell me I’m just overthinking this. All of your future plans for us are my actual life goals. So please, don’t leave me. Stay with me. I love you so much that I don’t even wanna lose you.
How can anyone feel that it’s okay to lie to someone yet expect them to trust you with everything you say… How is it okay to cheat in a relationship, lie constantly about things yet expect them not to find out..  Relationships don’t last long anymore because everyone would rather find someone new than figure things out together, talk things out and make things work.. What’s the point of even trying in a relationship if the other person is just going to leave you when they’ve had enough.. What’s the point of trying to stay strong if all the people who promise to be there for you just walk away from you when you need help but expect you to drop everything to help them when they need anything.. What honestly is the point of trying at all if nobody stays true to their word anymore..
My ideal relationship is with someone who complements me and I them. Our individual selves are highlighted and enhanced when we are together. Together we are much stronger than as individuals, which is impressive, because as individuals we are both amazing and powerful people. We feel strongly about each other in an esoteric way that we cant explain. We tackle the world head on as we continue to grow into our own unique selves. We want the same things out of life and inspire people to join us with the purity of our purpose and our passionate, fresh, magical ways. Together we don’t become more separate from the world - we become more a part of it. Together we change the world.
Sometimes it sucks being single until I see relationships can suck ass too. I’d rather be a mess on my own than bring somebody else into my shit. Then again nobody wants to date me do I don’t got to worry about that. :)
I really just want to be in a relationship so that I can have a person to cuddle all the time
*fights urges on how to google how to make you fall in love with me again*
12/18/15  you know what I’ll never understand? how when we were breaking up, we both said we wanted to be friends and that you’ll keep in touch because if we really felt that strongly for one another we couldn’t just let go, right? then how is it that after that day I never heard from you again. and when I tried to reach out to you, you were so cold. so mean. so hurtful. like I never meant anything.  you could see how I might go a little crazy. I still wanted to talk to you but here I am. making shit up in my head and driving myself insane because maybe I never meant anything to you at all and that kills me.
So I read an article on fb about reasons to have friends with benefits over a significant other… The fuck?! Basically it’s telling you, FWBs are better because you don’t have to become attached, you don’t have to have regards for their feelings, and you can basically just throw them away when you’re bored with them. Soooooo what you’re telling people is to just go be a slut and sleep around because in the end you don’t have to worry about attachments? Whom ever wrote that is probably one of the lowest and sleaziest people in existence, and seriously disgusts me. I may not want ANYTHING to do with relationships right now but I sure as hell am not just going to go around and sleep with people or do things with them just because I can. Grow up.
My bf is a foot taller than me and I have to go on my tip toes to reach him properly and he holds me up so I can stay. It is nice. I also sit on his lap almost always and it is so fun to dangle my legs and not touch the floor. I am happy in his arms, and he always tells me he loves me more than anything. We fit like a puzzle and we both know it.
I think part of my problem is when talking to someone you’ve known for a long time, and you start to become attracted to one another, you’re scared that either decision to either try to do it, or just walk away, can hurt that other person or make them happy. But how long will that happiness last? A month? Year? 2 years? Etc. What it takes is patience and understanding and as I’ve grown and gone through the motions of relationships and dates. I realize you have to let others as long as yourself grow, you may not like all of their decisions but you still must support them and their passion. Be accepting of the things in their life. I still may be a young man but I will always remember this lesson which I think will help me further in life. Just scared of my feelings for this person.
Relationships are cool because you have that one person who will listen to you and genuinely care about you and be there for you and you can just feel the love in the air
be active for the next day or so. I have my memere’s funeral and I’m practicing the eulogy…plus my ex and I are hanging out for the first time since we broke up so it’s gonna be emotional
When I look into your eyes, it makes my heart smile
Long story short. Crazy ex of mine and crazy ex of his decide to gossip about me and the guy I am currently talking to. I confronted them booth and the crazy boy was lying for sure, but apparently the girl is telling some truth about how my current guy is still trying to get with her, but yet he still talks to me. I confront current guy and we talk things out and were good yanno? Then ANOTHER guy that I had a relationship in the summer. Well not a relationship I was basically his side hoe. (Dark days I am ashamed) recently broke up with his girlfriend and expects me to run into his arms whole heartedly. He asks me on a date today I said yes, thought about it, then told him I changed my mind. Them he shows up anyway when my current guy decides he wants to go get some teapioca and so I tell the other guy to leave I don’t want anything to do with him eat AND HE REFUSES TO LEAVE. He stays and even flashes his lights for my current guy to find his way to my house, like are you kidding me. Leave me alone. Then I go out with the current guy and we have a good time and he pulls up to my house and…. MY EX DECIDES TO SHOW UP WHO HAS BEEN MAD AT ME FOR A COUPLE DAYS FOR HAVING FEELS FOR CURRENT GUY. I literally cannot catch a break. I’m pretty sure my current guy thinks I’m a slut and is gonna distance himself pretty soon. WHY CANT THEY JUST LEAVE ME ALONE. So basically I have decided to tell every guy I meet that I’m lesbian to avoid these situations. Please send help.
632 days of my life wasted falling in love with a man who has proved didn’t care about me at all. 632 days where for once in my life i actually felt happy and like i was good enough.  Urg it’s funny how the 632 best days of my life paved the way for the worst time of my life. God knows how many days this is going to last, if i make it that far.
We hear a car door slam outside, and freeze. Mark shoves me into his closet with my purse and boots. I wait in the dark, looking into the space beside me for murderers. This house is full of so much, just so MUCH. I think of earlier when Mark was mad the cats were peeing on the carpet downstairs. They’re supposed to go in my mom’s room! he said. Their litter box is in her room? He shakes his head, I’ll show you. And we walk into his mom’s room, where he points to the only place on the floor that isn’t covered with boxes or clothes or shoes or papers or hangers. He points to a strip of carpet beside the bed where dozens of dry turds lay in a pile. My jaw drops open. I am always surprised, but I shouldn’t be.  Mark opens the closet door, tells me his sister just forgot something. You want to go home now, don’t you? Yes… and no, I want to tear this house apart. My head hurts, and I’m waiting to throw up from the acetaminophen I took (I’m not supposed to take it with my medication). Mark is begging to come home with me so he can have a real dinner, and I’m begging in the morning for him to hang out with me. I’m crying—how do I tell him I can’t sleep without him? how do I tell him I can’t shower without him? How do I tell him i’m scared because now I need him? We tip the piggy bank over. Pennies tumble out and confirm our desperation. We are hungry. We are bored. We want we want we want we want and it hurts to hold up my head. Mark points out the acne on my butt. I pointedly stare at the stretch marks on his butt, silently saying we are even. I know he is not doing it to be mean, but I need to be in a world that is fair. I am crying into my phone, screaming at Mark, realizing he is just as much a problem as he is a solution
could someone maybe point me to somewhere that a small shy bean like me can learn how to properly interact with a crush please
When you think he’s bae, but he goes to bed too early
I’ve been thinking tonight about the first time we kissed. You held me in your arms so closely and your lips were pressed against mine. I had never felt anything like that before. I had never before felt the passion and fire in my heart and soul that I felt that night. I had never felt the sparks that burned so lightly on the edge of my skin. When I kissed you that night, you lit a fire in my soul that is burning like the sun even today.  We had been walking along the beach for a while, and when I looked at you I saw the stars in your eyes. I never wanted to leave that place with you. When you told me about the constellations and pointed them out to me, I looked at you instead of the sky to see your smile light up my world.  When we sat on the concrete and you slowly put your arm around me to stop my shivering, I looked at you and blushed. When you hesitantly laced your fingers with mine, my heart wanted to burst from my chest. Every single touch between us was red hot on my skin. When you told me about your love for music, I felt our souls beginning to connect. When you told me about your past, I felt strings being tied between us. I knew in that moment that I never wanted to be apart from you. You pulled me into your arms and I instantly felt warm and safe. I pressed my head against your chest, and I heard your heart beating for the very first time. I looked up at you, and you looked down at me, and swept me into your kiss.  I’ve never felt more alive than in that moment, with the waves crashing behind us and fireworks exploding to our left and right and in between us with every single touch of our skin. I’ve never wanted anyone so badly, I’ve never felt so much passion and pure energy in a single gaze.  It was in that moment that I started to fall in love with you. And god, do I wish you had never walked away from me.
i think the saddest kind of breakup is when two people never make amends and basically cut eachother out of their lives. maybe a hey or small talk every now and then, but the friendship they once had is now a distant memory.
are there any akoiromantics out there who have found someone they love and are able to be with that person? I identify as akoiromantic, I’m with someone I care about and I’ve been okay for like 3 weeks since getting together with them, but now I’m feeling weird about the relationship (he’s not doing anything wrong). I’ve had a crush on him for years and he treats me so well, and I really wanna give this relationship a fair shot… Help?
My hands ached vividly with phantom memories.  A ghost was holding my hand, interlacing our fingers tightly.  Reenacting the story of a love long dead, it taunted without mercy. Reminding me that my heart is still broken.  My hands are still haunted. Though his bed has been filled and his mind has been emptied. Mine never will be.
Abusive relationships don’t always have to be physical. Know the signs. 1. There are red flags from the beginning. If from the start something doesn’t feel right, it probably isn’t – don’t convince yourself that it’s a hurdle you’ll have to clear to get to a good, healthy relationship. If something makes you hesitant, uneasy, or anxious from day one, I can guarantee you it will not go away. 3 months or 3 years later, the same red flags will exist, try as you might to disregard them. 2. The intentions are never clear. That little voice in the back of your head keeps saying you’re being played, messed with, or generally screwed over.  3. You doubt yourself. Call it insecurity, call it whatever you want – but that little voice knows a lot more than you give it credit for. Don’t downplay your own nagging notions, don’t brush off how you feel. You’re the only one who knows yourself.  4. You feel guilty for feeling this way. When approached with the idea that you’re not sure of his/her true feelings, he/she will make you feel guilty for not seeing “everything I do for you”, “how many times I say ____”, etc. Actions always speak louder than words, don’t forget that. He/she can hit you with all the “I love you”s you could ask for, but when you’re lying awake at night anxious and worried that it isn’t true, those words mean nothing. Not to mention that while you’re staring at the ceiling, tossing and turning, he/she is fast asleep, not a care in the world. 5. You take hits. Physical or emotional. If every compliment feels backhanded in some way, every piece of “advice” a lowkey dig – that’s simply not nice. If what he/she says in person, over the phone, texts, etc. makes your heart sink or your eyes burn a little – take that as a huge hit. If you spend more time tending after wounds that he/she inflicted rather than feeling uplifted, supported, motivated, and generally cared for – that is not a relationship. If you find yourself on the sidewalk crying as you’re yelled at, reprimanded, even verbally assaulted through the phone, find the power to hang up, get up, and go.  6. You take gifts. And after he/she is done yelling, insulting, what have you, she/he will return with presents, kind words, tender touches. It’s not real. It’s supposed to placate you, and it will, because all during his/her yelling rampage, you craved his/her gentler side, which in reality might not even be real. 7. You are made to feel unappreciative. When voicing your feelings about things he/she has said or done that have hurt you, you’re “negative” for not seeing the positive side in arguments. You are unappreciative of all the work he/she puts into being with you, all the times he/she has stayed up at night just to work things out with you, or in the rare case, has caught the last train into New York to show up outside your dorm just to “make sure you were okay.” 8. You are unappreciated. It seems that every text you send is ignored, all the times you’ve put your feelings aside are neglected, and you are generally unimportant. That he/she is the focus of the relationship, and your goals, feelings, needs, and wants are disregarded. 9. You are coddled. Again, when bringing up that you feel unappreciated, if he/she doesn’t fly off the handle, he/she will coddle you and sweet-talk you into believing that those little voices in your head and heart clearly don’t know what they’re talking about, because clearly he/she loves you based on these (rare) gentle actions.  10. You hold your tongue. You find that you refrain from saying how you really feel to avoid an argument, because he/she is scary when they’re mad; because you don’t want him/her to leave you just because you couldn’t keep your mouth shut. You should never feel the need to sit down and think about every word that will come out of your mouth before you say it. 11. You feel the need to prove yourself. He/she might use phrases like “love takes time”, “trust is earned”, etc. Truth be told: you don’t need to prove yourself to anybody. The important people will recognize value without any direct action from you. The people who truly know you – know your heart, your mind, and your soul – know your worth. You know your worth too. Don’t settle.  12. You are controlled. He/she makes commends on what you wear, what you eat, who your friends are, how you spend your free time. Like a third parent, but worse. This includes being told not to wear makeup, to go to the gym more, etc. He will look at you and not comment on how pretty you look, but instead say, “makeup is gross.” Will say things like “if you keep going to the gym, you’ll really have me hooked.” And “It’s so attractive when men/women ______.” (Insert something you don’t do.) Just to remind you that you’re not good enough as you are. 13. You feel special. He/she will tell you how he/she never does this with anybody, how he/she has never found somebody so special, how if you were gone, he/she would never find somebody who could put up with him/her like you can. Maybe even, for bonus points, throw in the idea that God put you two together, made your paths cross for some divine reason. All of these to convince you, again, that the voice in your head is crazy for thinking otherwise. 14. Your friends and family see the signs. When relaying arguments or disagreements to your close friends and family, they become concerned, confused, and generally wary of the relationship. Turning questions like “yeah, but are you happy?” and “that doesn’t sound right to me…that’s not right at all.” While you do know yourself the best, your family and your friends have outsider perspectives. Sometimes you can’t see something when it’s right in front of you. Hindsight is 20/20, but so is Mom-vision.  15. You still doubt yourself. Even though you agree with and relate to every aspect of the previous points, you still convince yourself that it isn’t like that. Yes, you’re the one in the relationship, and only you know how you feel. And that if he/she shows up asking for a second chance, you’ll give it to him/her. And when he/she does return (which he/she will), flowers in hand, puppy eyes and everything, saying he/she made a huge mistake and that you’re a crucial component to his/her life, don’t be softened. For once, put yourself first, put your foot down. If you truly believe the two of you are strong enough to change the relationship for the better and progress as people, by all means, go for it. But if there’s even the slightest bit of doubt that nothing will change, that you’re going back into a relationship that didn’t make you happy, take that to heart. You’re stronger than the people who cast you aside like you mean nothing. If he/she decides you aren’t “worthy”, or whichever word they choose: pity them. How sad is it to not know how to care for something of value. How sad for them that they can’t recognize beauty and unconditional care.  16. And when you finally break up, you’re angry and you’re sad, but the most powerful emotion is relief. And the one thing that everyone who knows you says – your mom, your manager, your roommate – is “I’m proud of you.” No “maybe you’re making the wrong choice”, “but didn’t he make you so happy” – “I’m proud of you.” The simplest most powerful four words in the world that will repeat in your head like a mantra as you pick yourself up, dust yourself off, and continue taking the world by storm.
That whole “ go thru your significant other” phone is some lame and petty bullshit.
I can’t wait to show him how awesome I am (or think I can be) when I’m not fighting anxiety or trying to not succumb to depression. If he loves me now he’ll want me forever then. I just gotta get there.
I want to play the game. So I asked my roommate how to play.  She says it’s very simple. It just involves lots of the right kind of eye contact, it involves giggling at the appropriate times and it involves smiling a lot. She says that it would be very easy for me to play and that I probably play all the time. I just don’t realize it, but I know that’s not true. I know I’m missing something and that prevents me from playing.  I don’t have any stories of people asking for my phone number or finding me on Facebook or asking about me at work. And in a way, it kinda depresses me. I can read a million articles and ask for advice from every person I meet, but that doesn’t mean I’ll be able to learn how to play. There’s always going to be something lacking in me and even though I don’t quite know what it is, it seems like everyone I interact with does. Maybe I’m not pretty enough, maybe I’m not interesting enough, maybe people look at me and know I’m not worth the effort. Whatever it is I don’t think I was meant to play and, no matter how much I wish it didn’t, that does make me very sad.

The best part of dating a gamer is that your video game library immediately doubles.
And we all have this person in our lives…wether it’s a crush, a best friend, or even a family member…we all have someone we would give the world for…but you know that no one would do the same to you….why does this tear us apart so easy…
“I want you to stay and be with me,” I look up at him, biting my lips. “It’s not gunna be like a Disney movie, August.” “Even if you stayed, you wouldn’t be with me.” “Probably not.” I turn over, angry. “Aw, come on, come here.” He puts his arms around me from behind, and I hate him. “Why do you make me feel special? Why do you tell me I am not like any other girl you’ve been with? Tell me everything that sets me apart and makes me special, and then tell me it doesn’t even matter because you would never be with me anyway.” “That’s not what I said. I just don’t want to force things. It doesn’t work like that.” “You say everything happens for a reason. That you have a deep feeling that something important is waiting for you in Miami. Then why don’t you consider how we started talking again right before you’re supposed to leave? Isn’t that a ‘sign?’” He sighs, noting my point. “You just want me to stay. Why don’t you let things happen naturally? Enjoy the time we have before I go.” “Because I need to know if it would work. I needed to be with Mark to realize that I didn’t want to be with him.” “That sounds like a trap.” “No. That’s not what I meant.” “Stop worrying.” I frown, sighing, and lay my cheek on his stomach.  “Did you know Aries and Cancer are like the least compatible?” I roll my eyes. I did know. “That’s why you won’t be with me?” “No,” he laughs, “that’s not why.” “Why did you have sex with me?” He puts his hands up, exasperated. “Does it just mean nothing to you?” “No. I do care about you.” “Do you even like me?” “Yes. I told you that. You ask me the same questions.” “Then why won’t you stay?” “I told you.” I look away, hiding my face with my hand. “I know what’s wrong with me. I am an extreme idealist. Last week, I was going to move to England and marry a guy in the army.” “That was last week?”  “Yeah,” I smile, knowing and hoping that soon I will find another man to fill his place, someone who is cuter, smarter, more put-together. Someone who will pry open my bony ribs and search through the gushing blood to find…me? somewhere behind this facade? this person I pretend to be? I know that’s not true, either, though. I know that he is right. Life isn’t a fairytale. I idealize men, and then wonder why reality is so disappointing. I want to be independent, but I’m afraid. I cling to the reassuring caress of men who annoy me, exasperate me. I only care about what they can do for me, rather than if I am good for them.   I lie to myself, thinking a man will uncover every secret about myself and the world that has and will always trouble me. I pretend he is my soulmate when I know that is bullshit, and that the first, best, and only lover I will have until death is myself. “You don’t love anyone,” I tell him. He frowns, “Why do people always say that to me?” “Because you don’t care.” “Yes I do.” “You don’t care that you’re hurting me.” “Don’t let yourself get so invested. I told you I was moving. You knew what was happening.” “I hate you.” I hang my head because I know I am being childish. “I am never talking to you again.” He pokes his lips out. “You can’t hurt me.” I think back to ninth grade, when he liked me, and I didn’t like him back. When I shut him out and stopped talking to him. I look at him, and I say, “I already have.”  He laughs. When it’s time for me to go, he notices that his bathroom floor is covered in water. I am mortified because it’s my fault I peed in his broken toilet. He starts to take me out through the garage, and it’s also filled with water that has slid under the doors of storage closets and soaked textbooks and family albums. There is nothing I can say to fix it, and I am so hurt by our conversation that all I really care about is myself anyway. I keep saying sorry because it is the only thing I can do, but I can’t even really feel the embarrassment I know I should feel from making his toilet flood his basement. I am too numb with rejection that he won’t be with me, won’t even consider it, and that it doesn’t bother him at all that I won’t see him for like six months at least, that we likely won’t stay in touch. The garage door opens, raining water droplets carelessly. It is suddenly clear that Daniel does not care about me. I had my chance four years ago, and now it is too late.
Please explain to me how and why people will ask someone out online, without having ever met them, and sometimes within a fucking day of beginning to talk to them. Like no, we gonna know each other IRL or it ain’t happening.
Relationships scare me. To be honest I’ve never been in one but idk man they scare me.
I'm so tired of this
<!-- more --> I’m really terrible at relationships. No matter what I do, who I’m with, I always fuck up big time. I just don’t know how to be in a fucking healthy and good relationship. I can picture it in my head, I can see myself doing good things and being a good girlfriend, I just haven’t been able to do it in real life yet. I wish I could just fix myself and be better at this kind of thing, but I don’t know how and it’s really fucking hard. I think I just get scared. Scared of what, I have no clue. It freaks me out when a person wants to spend so much time with me, when we’re always together and I have no space to myself. I hate it more when we have practically nothing to talk about, but not in the ‘comfortably sitting in silence’ kind of way but in the ‘this is incredibly awkward neither of us is talking please help’ kind of way. I want to make a good partner, I want to be good for someone, but I don’t know how to be. I’ve been thinking for some time now that I don’t think I’m well enough to be with someone right now, and the fact of the matter is I don’t know if I’ll live to see the day that I am. I don’t see much of a future for myself, so how could I see myself being with a person for any length of time. Snd then I just always end up hurting the other person anyways, either by doing something wrong or by not doing anything at all, and I hate it. I hate hurting people I care about. People think its funny when I say I’m not a good person to be in a relationship with, they laugh when I say I’m just bad at relationships, and then they get into a relationship with me and they stop thinking it’s funny. I just wish I could stop being terrible at this because, for once, I’d like to have a good relationship. It’s probably sad that the healthiest relationship I’ve had was with with a guy who turned out to be gay too. Maybe if I get better one day and stop feeling the things I do I’ll have a successful relationship, but until then I don’t know if it’ll ever actually happen.
When I’m alone, I can still feel his hands around my neck, squeezing, his thumb digging into my trachea, making it impossible to breathe.  My feet scraped against the wall, searching for a foothold, while my hands tried to pry his fingers away from my throat, and then just loosen them. Until I began to just slap at them, stab at them, punch them:  uselessly. Looking directly across from me into the eyes of the man who slept with a teddy bear, who painted my toenails,  who laid next to me until I fell asleep, who asked me to marry him, I only saw anger. I saw a monster. It was not the same person. When he threw me, it felt strangely like when my uncle would throw me into the pool when I was younger: panic, betrayal, and surprise that it was so easy to fling me into the air. The right side of my body took the weight of my fall, the carpet of my dorm room dragging marks into my skin. I did not know then, in January, that I hit the surface of the pool, water slapping against my skin. I sunk to the bottom and drown. Only now, six months later, do I realize that I have been floating around the dark bottom of the pool ever since, watching the air bubbles leave my lips.
My parents have been married for 35 years.  Flashback to 37 years ago - my parents were just dating. My mom wanted their relationship to get more serious but my dad wasn’t on the same wave length. He was happy living with his best friends and staying up all night long and eating pizza and writing music. He loved my mom but he didn’t want to change. One night, after a lot of fighting about this very same topic, my parents broke up.  My mom ran out of the apartment sobbing. It was raining hard and about halfway down the block, she looked back to see if my dad had run after her. He hadn’t. She decided that she should wait in an alleyway, because surely he would come and say that he changed his mind, right? Well, he didn’t. And after waiting and hysterically crying for 20 minutes in the rain, she went home.  For some reason this story is comforting to me. Obviously my parents made up. Obviously my dad grew up a little bit and they eventually got married - they are even happier now than i’ve ever seen them. I guess this story is comforting to me because it’s SO DRAMATIC. My mom clearly knew she wanted to spend the rest of her life with this man, and he would just not get his shit together. Can you imagine how devastated she was? Can you imagine how much her world had been shattered in that moment?  And yet…life moves on. Of course you are not always gonna marry the man who doesn’t run after you (and often, you shouldn’t, although my dad is the best guy in the world so WHAT DO I KNOW??), but it just reminds me that the things that seem like they may be the end of the world often aren’t. And that we’re all going to be okay. And that we will be able to tell these stories 35 years later with our friends and a bottle of wine and laugh our asses off about them.  What I’m trying to say is… don’t stress too much. It’s all gonna work out in the end.
“Or I’ll just kill her.” She said, “Or I’ll just kill her if I have to.” She laughed, but we both knew she wasn’t joking. And I don’t mean to glorify violence or condone it. But I dream of a dagger, one that would slice open the sides of his neck on either side in precisely the places where he dug his thumb and index finger into mine, pinning me against the wall. I want to watch blood spurt from the same places on his neck where he dared to place his hands on mine. “Or I’ll just kill her.” Oh yes, I know, what it was like to hide under your bed when she broke into your house,  what it was like to hide behind a locked bathroom door while he banged against it. I know what it was like when you called the police, but they wouldn’t believe you because suddenly your abuser is all charm and smiles. It was all a misunderstanding. I know what it was like to have someone say, “It’s your fault for staying with them.” I know what it is like to dream of a blade worthy enough to put fear into their eyes the way they instilled it into us. Even years later, We carry that fear with us. We hold each other close, and though we’ve found our other half to make us whole, and though we’ve found the one who understands, we fall asleep at night holding each other’s hands, but we sleep fitfully, fear still alive and well under those lids, fear that was placed there by a former lover, fear that left scars so deep, our only defense  is to dream  of blades sharp enough, fists strong enough, hearts… whole enough, healed enough, full enough of the strength we must grow  to dare to forgive.
It seems that in my search for something real, I am always leaving behind my social circles. The people I ran with in DC and Northern Virginia, the people who Playing With Rats is about, are a distant memory that I am not trying to glorify by telling those stories. I knew that if I stayed in that life it was going to lead to my death, either by drinking myself to death or by violence. My search for spiritual meaning and real relationships with people who could understand my thoughts led me out.    I ended up in Maine, sometimes living in an apartment and sometimes my car in the woods, but even with family up there I couldn’t make meaningful connections or have real conversation, outside of one person. I did meet members of the Wampanoag tribe from Massachusetts there who took me in and I will be writing about my time with them and my reason for leaving. I will say that it was one of the best times of my life.   Moving back to Virginia and working with the church was a ten year endeavor that rewarded me with my wife and two children, but outside friendships were never cemented and betrayal was as common as on the streets, just without the violence.   My decision to leave Christianity and adopt heathenry has given me great strength and restored order to my life that was lacking after the cognitive dissonance I went through during the transition away from Christianity. I will be writing about that later also.   My last social circle was at a cigar shop. Good conversation, poker games and cigars. Unfortunately, none of those people, even the ones who have similar social and political views as myself, could give a damn if I were there or not. There are so many people there that if someone leaves it doesn’t seem to matter, and most of them were Christians so my religion always made me an outsider, even though I could discuss theology easily as I was a minister and evangelist. For some I was a threat, for others I was just “other,” damned to hell for all eternity.    I knew the time was approaching when I started to sense the divide; of politics, morals, history and views of what is to come, and the sense that sitting in a smoke filled room for hours was a waste of my body and lungs, a lifestyle that would one day catch up to haunt them.    I quit drinking a couple of months ago, started seriously studying the runes, exercising regularly, and am now weening myself off of cigars. I look into my children’s eyes, so alive when they see me. I hear my wife’s voice, glad to have me around. I go to bed earlier and sleep better. I made a decision to give myself, my time, wholly to those who love me in return and seek me out, instead of those who only acknowledge me when I am around.    Being a Traditionalist is difficult in this world. Riding the Tiger takes discipline. In some ways it is lonelier, but it gives me more time to learn what I am passionate about and to develop myself to my fullest potential. I have not truly run from anything. I have run to what I desired all along.
don’t like guys hitting on you? you need to understand guys can’t get any female companionship unless they’re assertive. women don’t come up to guys and ask them out, even hot guys. so guys have to hit on girls. that’s reality. we have no choice. you are just going to have to learn to deal with it and accept it.
never settle for 2nd best, if someone can’t own up and be there for you, then they don’t deserve you. NEVER settle for second.
You have time to post of Facebook but can’t text me back at all today? That makes real sense…if you’re going to act like you’re busy or whatever, at least block the posts from me. Ugh…
A part of me honestly wants to tell you how I’ve progressed… or what I’m working towards. To show you that i’m not the person that you portray me to be. The person you want others to see. I’m sorry that I hurt you that much to wish hateful things towards me. To make others see me the way you do. When i only and always wished the best for you. But I couldn’t bare being loved half way, I didn’t want to settle for a love that stayed at “almost love”. My heart gravitated towards something greater because I knew i was worthy of so much more. I just could no longer silence what I once have. No more.
i feel the intense urge to go on an adventure but specifically with my boyfriend. unfortunately that’s not an option seeing as he’s 900 miles away…
Some people aren’t loyal to you. They’re loyal to their NEED of you. Once their need changes, so does their loyalty.
IM SUPPOSED TO BE OVER YOU! I SHOULDN’T WALK IN A STORE SEE A GUY WHO DRESSES LIKE YOU, LOOKS LIKE YOU, AND HAS YOUR BIG BROWN EYES AND FEEL HURT. I OWE MORE TO MY BOYFRIEND THAN THIS. I SHOULDN’T FEEL LIKE THIS. why did you do this to me….why.
Do you imagine an image of 2 hands holding each other, then releasing in tears? I imagine the arms, but instead of letting go I picture the hands tight together, but the arms break apart; leaving the holding hands to fall together. Aside from the pun of a literal ‘break-up’, I figured it represented it was something those two people decided to drop from their lives, which leaves a scar on you and it is not something that can be replaced, much like you can almost never replace a person’s limbs unless you get a fake… but no one likes a fake right? The only people who can sew the arms on together is them, they’ll never feel those same hands and feeling in their arms again.
Everyone is in relationships being all cute and I’m over here like look at how much of this FUCKING PIZZA I CAN SHOVE IN MY MOUTH.
I’m not gonna lie I was really nervous to go on a trip with the bf. Things have been kinda hard lately with my finals and our opposite work schedules. My last serious relationship ended when we were on a vacation together. It was horrible. We finally got into one final argument and it just exploded. And after two years of dating we decided to call it quits that night on our trip. That was 4 years ago.  But this trip went extremely well. Zero arguing. We traveled well together and talked about things we need to work on in our relationship and what we want for the future. We also had a blast.
I know there are a lot of problems with The Big Bang Theory, but it’s still a show I enjoy, and more importantly, it’s a show my mother and I enjoy together. I watched the new episode tonight where Sheldon and Amy finally have sex. Before this, I really didn’t like how they handled Sheldon’s indifference to sex. Everyone treated that aspect like Sheldon was different and weird and needed to be fixed, and it always rubbed me the wrong way. But I feel like tonight’s episode handled everything a lot better than I was expecting. I think Sheldon’s reasoning for wanting to was valid and realistic. And Amy was adorable. So all in all, I’d say this was a pretty good episode.
HOW CAN YOU BE SO WRONG ABOUT A PERSON AFTER SO LONG?
I never understood those posts about finding the love of your life at the wrong time until all of this started to take place. I hope one day in the future, whether next week, next year, or 10 years from now I can find you again. I can find you and we can laugh at how stupid I was, how naive and childish I always acted, or your attitude. We can laugh about all the things that tore us apart and use it to bridge the gaps that time has created.
I may not say it but you’re very special to me.
“Fun and easygoing” me. I’ve noticed something strange lately. People are treating me differently. People actually seem to like being around me. Someone at work told me everyone who sits at our table says they love working with me because I’m fun, easygoing, and know what I’m doing. Of course I know what I’m doing but fun and easygoing? Me? I’ve also noticed people–even total strangers–smiling at me more. I always used… View On WordPress
I’m hopefully going to die tonight, so I just want to say goodbye, I guess. Zak doesn’t give a fuck, naturally. No one fucking gives a shit so I’m better off dead. I’m sorry. Stay safe x
The person you’re with should be your hero. They should also be your precious sweetheart that you want to protect at all costs.
At the beginning of the year I told myself I’d go to as many dates as I could with different men. I don’t know why I wanted to do that but I did.   Looking back. That was quite a fun experience. I had dates with the funny, the young, the monied, the old, the just-tryina-get-laid. Yea. The list goes on. It feels like 2015 was a whirlwind of sorts and only now is the wind starting to quiet down and the calm is coming back with me trying to restore order in my world again. Anyway, after my dating experience this year. I’ve come up with a list that describes the type of man/men one should avoid. Yea I do all the foolish things so you don’t have to. You’re welcome. So here goes. A man you should not waste your time with:  -who’s not sure what y'all are.  -who “can’t” handle feelings.  -who shows up at your place drunk at midnight.  -who can go for days without seeing or talking to you.  -who always has stuff to do but none of it with you.  -who thinks you’re “too much”.  -whose kisses are a disaster.  -who’s not ready to commit… to you.  -who “wants to take care of you.”  -who wants to take you to his hotel room before your first date.  -who wants you to send him a pic “for his eyes” only.  -who thinks he’s the sun.  -who says he’s a “private man” but EVERYONE knows he loves cheese crackers.  -who wants you guys to “take it slow”.  -who has too many excuses for why he can’t see you. -who thinks sex is for him. -who tells you what a “good woman” should do/not do. -who calls himself humble. -who calls himself “God-fearing”. -who’s a religious fanatic.  -who speaks ill of his exes. -who thinks spending money on you means you owe him or better yet, he owns you. -who thinks he’s doing you a favor by giving you compliments. -who only compliments you when drunk or high. -who tells you what to wear/not wear. -who wants you to “make him feel like a man”. 🙄😴 -who thinks a penis makes him an expert in anything or everything apart from you know, having a penis. -who criticizes you. -who calls you crazy. -who thinks anything and everything is “gay”. (bonus point. he prolly is the gay one) -who’s homophobic, sexist, racist,  -who says you have to do anything “because you are a woman”. -who says he has to do anything “because he’s a man.” -who wants you to be grateful he loves you (he doesn’t) The list is long please feel free to add on to it.
The difference i see in loving someone and being in love with someone is simple: If I love you, I could feel that way again about someone else if I lose you. (Even if that’s a harsh reality) But if I’m in love with you, no day will ever be complete without hearing from you. No one will ever know me or experience me the way you will. I will never love someone as wholly as I love you because, if I lose you, I will lose a part of me that no one else will ever have. And I think that’s the difference: how irreplaceable I believe you to be. True love cannot be replaced.
Serenity Falconreach Inn was the first actual inn either of them have stayed in. Tannim knew of Sabrina but hardly was around to know her. However, he did notice when Serenity was around, considering Serenity’s a lot nicer. Rune’s only known of Serenity as the innkeeper because of his later appearance in Falconreach. Tannim finds Serenity to be very sweet and concerned when she really doesn’t have to be. He, like many other adventurers, think of her as a motherly figure although Tannim isn’t too familiar with motherly love. He thinks of Serenity as a warmth for a fire. She’s also a friend that he tends to swap cooking ideas with as he is one of the main cooks in his household.  Rune knows Serenity’s nice and all but he tends not to have that same feeling of mothering that everyone else has. Mainly because Rune feels that he might end up hating Serenity just for the association to a mother and he doesn’t want that. She’s that concerned friend to Rune, usually the one to cut him off when he’s clearly drunk, make him stop smoking when she think it’s past the point of being any ‘help’ to him, and ensure him a room if he’s too exhausted to walk home.   Zhoom He’s one of the few people that can legitimately annoy Tannim. Like he could probably get Tannim to get some semblance of a scowl. And honestly, Zhoom isn’t as bad as most that Tannim encounters. So why does Zhoom get to him? Tannim isn’t quite sure but usually keeps himself under control while around him.He thinks of Zhoom like another Rune and he admits that he can’t handle more than one at any given time. Zhoom is Rune’s mentor as a ranger, the class he normally keeps to. Yet they have blurred lines of a student/teacher a few times. Rune liked proving Zhoom wrong when haughty about the ability to survive in the Sandsea. The competitiveness and simple curiosity have led to close calls. Rune has slept with Zhoom before and they both maintain that it is nothing romantic. Despite this, Zhoom was distraught at the duo’s ‘betrayal’ but did forgive by the end of the Light Orb saga. He’s still a good friend to Rune as well as an useful informant.   Galanoth Tannim initially was enthralled by Galanoth. He could tell the dragonslayer was strong and wanted nothing more than exchange blades with him. Galanoth didn’t mind but thought Tannim might be a little too inexperienced to do so. However that fight changed their minds as Tannim held his own despite Gal’s advantage and getting a scrape from it. Galanoth remained concerned of the duo’s presence, still thinking they are ‘young’ and not durable enough to survive any assistance they were giving him. After Rune came back from the ice caverns with an unconscious Tannim in tow, Gal got suspicious as the wound he gave Tannim should’ve closed up fine and only would’ve continued bleeding if he’d struck a dragon. Tannim said he had no such thing in his blood but the physical evidence was there. Galanoth believed Tannim was lying but because of matters in Dragesvard and Rune’s watchful eye, he could do nothing about it. Despite truly not knowing, Tannim felt terrible of angering Gal and was somewhat afraid of Galanoth because if he was partially dragon, he might kill him. But since the incident and finding out what he is, Tannim has owned up to it and admitted he didn’t know about it until the time he tells Galanoth. By this time, Galanoth has had time to cool off an time to know more about Tannim to figure he’s an honest person and that he is a friend no matter what his lineage is. Rune had no strong feelings towards Galanoth, being only another means to eventually find an orb. He was curious about Galanoth being a dragonslayer as he never encountered one before. He took notes as Tannim and Galanoth fought and only asked about learning dragoslaying afterwards. While Rune didn’t know, Galanoth noticed Rune in bandages under his clothes while they were doing something. He said no, citing that Rune might not be strong enough to be one. Rune took some offense but didn’t let it hinder what he was doing. Galanoth changed his mind after Rune returned with Tannim from the ice caves and having to take Rune’s jabs with it. They were people who could dine together in a tavern or even just drink however Galanoth had some friction with Rune because of his lack of discipline as a student. This and Rune keeping Galanoth distant from Tannim since them coming back. They remain in rather warm waters although they would not mind helping the other out if it was within a reasonable cause.   Demento Tannim didn’t get to know Demento for very long. With the chaos of the Fire War and personal strife, he didn’t get to really how the man was. The little time he did have, Tannim knows of Demento being nicer but just as fierce as his brother.  Rune knew of Demento prior to the Fire War as he helped Demento with dragons that were coming from the south to cause havoc in Falconreach. Because it was a combination of waiting for them and setting up a counter strike, Rune spent some time planning with Demento, and a few days of recovery after they were victorious. Demento remarked he doubted it was the last time he’d meet Rune and his words became true. They ended up planning as they had before and quiet nights of being on watch. Demento was the one that encouraged Rune to make up with Tannim after they’d had a fight and ended their partnership. They considered doing something further but because of the circumstances of the war, they did not. When told of Demento having left something, Rune felt suspicious and went to investigate only to find him dying. It is a small regret Rune has but chooses not to dwell on it.   Warlic Tannim doesn’t know what he thinks of Warlic. He just knows that Warlic isn’t exactly someone he normally hangs around and that a lot of Warlic’s talk doesn’t make sense to him. Warlic however knows of Tannim prior to the duo coming to his tent. He’d diagnosed what was wrong with Tannim when he was in a coma-like state after a night that nearly ended with his and Andrei’s death. Because Nythera was a student to him, he was able to figure out that Tannim has some kind of draconic blood in him. He told both Andrei and Lady Celestia that it was a dangerous power as even unconsciously, he decimated part of a forest. Tannim never knows of this connection and just find Warlic a little sad to be around. And while he has a close friendship with Xan, he doesn’t hold this over Warlic. He and Rune both maintain some inside joke of mages being drama queens. Rune hadn’t heard of Warlic until Tannim tells him about it. He figures out that this is the mage his master used to complain and lament about. Warlic feels Rune would be a powerful mage but is too unruly for it and secretly is reminded of how he used to be. Rune tends to come to his tent to read books and only the minimum amount of talking necessary. Warlic told Rune about Tannim in the Fire War, in addition to something else: that his presence was identical to Akriloth…if not stronger. Having seen Akriloth’s destruction and knowing of Rune’s fight with Tannim, though Rune would be logical and allow Tannim to be put down. Rune instead said that he may have fought with Tannim, that he’s a pain in the ass and annoying, but if he was that sort of person, he didn’t deserve any praise of a hero. Since Rune holds Warlic at arms distance. He is certain of Warlic holding back knowledge and gets annoyed by such a person.
To make a mistake and feel that your entire world is going to come crashing down … anxiety really can suck it hard this time.
I love the kind of relationship where two people tease each other all the time but then get really protective if the other is insulted by someone else
I just wrapped my boyfriends Christmas presents and I did I really shitty job
HOW HARD IS IT TO TEXT SOMEONE BACK, EVEN IF TO JUST SAY YOURE DONE AND DONT WANT TO SEE ME ANYKORE??? like seriously that’s all I want and now I’m just pissed off
I don’t want to be in a relationship where the guy spoils, I’m learning to be independent and I’ll spoil myself. I don’t need a man to be a Queen. But what I do want is to be happy with the person I’m with. I want them to make sure I’m okay. I want them to calm me down during my panic attacks. I want them to hold me when I cry and tell me everything will be okay. I want them to be able to handle my bipolar days and days where I have anxiety attacks and mental breakdowns. I want someone to remind me I’m beautiful when I forget. I want someone to support me through life and to push me to be a better stronger woman.

1 week after break up: Everyone is telling me to keep this front when I see my ex after 4 years together bc they don’t want her to see me upset. What’s wrong with that though? I know I’m moving on slowly, but I should be upset. I wanted to spend my life with her and then I was cheated on… it shows how much I cared for such a horrible person. I was loyal as fuck until the very end even though she treated me like shit for an entire month and I just continued to trust her and wait for her to come back to me… I loved her so much that I literally was waiting for her. Of course I didn’t deserve that. She didn’t deserve all the things I did for her and how much love I put into the relationship. But why can’t I be upset? The loyal ones are always the ones to deal with the damage after the relationship, and then there’s her who got in a new relationship the night of our break up. What the fuck? Why do I have to put up a front when I know I’m moving on. Who cares what she thinks at this point… If she wanted to hurt me, it’s obvious she did. I don’t think putting up a front matters anymore.
I remembered all the things we did. I took the walk you told me not too, but memories are still instilled in my mind. You helped me, completed me and now the half that has left has left me unbalanced. It was us who chose this, but I still wonder if it was wrong.  I realize my weaknesses now and they scare me because I am now vulnerable to myself. To my true self. The past in which was with you has now passed, but still rings my mind when I think.
I messed up again wi th another date and n o w I’m pretty sure them and several others hate me everyone is so done with my crap I do n’t know what to do, they sh ould both just break up with me so I can go kill myself I was supposed to last night but I fell asleep because my body is ridiculous  my boyfriend’ s no t talking to me and I’m freaking out even though I know he’s busy doing a raid in Destiny// but it;s either that or he’s upset at me and hates me and want’s to break up ith m e I had to block hi m on tumbllr so my date coul d feel safe and comfortabl e but I dk how to tell him I did that  he on ly follows m e because he likes to look at my pictures and s ee me face he doens’ care about anything el s e He’s a sweetheart and I hate doin g this to him, I don’t wan t anyone to be upset, I didn’t mean to hurt a nyone I didn’t th ink I did it again and I didn’t think b efore I spoke and no w I’m probably gonna have 2 n ew exes I want to die
When it comes to relationships, in my opinion…if your girl wanna go blasting the radio in your car because she likes that song and starts dancing and singing stupidly. Let her, if she feels comfortable enough around you to act silly, don’t ever tell her no she can’t because “you don’t like her blasting the music” or “loud music isn’t your thing” if you can’t handle her, you’re weak and natural selection is coming for you.
She hoped he would love her the way he loved his guitar.  And he did.  He played her.

Friend: He's really cute and we have so much in common. Me: Okay yeah that's great but what's his credit score?
Why do I always have to make things so hard for myself, I always think the worst and cant keep negative thoughts out of my head instead I obsess over them. I push those closest to me away all the time, the exact opposite of what I really want to do, I just don’t help myself, the worst part is making the lives of those around me harder, sometimes I feel like I’m just waiting for the worst to happen.
I like the idea of a relationship, but the thought of actually having one scares the hell outta me! :/
A few weeks a go my best friend invited me to meet her boyfriend for the first time over a dinner, they had also invited to of his best friends (that I had never met before). In my opinion I and one of these friends, lets call him Q, got along very well and I think I might like him a bit. And then a few days ago me and my best friend + my other best friend went to see a movie. Q had no one to go with so my friend invited him to go with us, but he said he didn’t want to and my friend part 1.part 2. my friend said that it was because he liked someone. She didn’t want to say who because she thought that it would be mean to tell incase he wanted it to be a secret. But I can’t wrap my head around why he wouldn’t want to go with us unless he liked one of us and thought it would be embarrassing. But then if he liked one of us then wouldn’t he want to go with us? He probably doesn’t like the one who told him and the other girl he doesn’t know. So do you think he might like me Hey sugar,  Well, I can’t really make any judgement based on such little information. But if he says he likes someone, and your friend is in a relationship, it means its probably you or the other friend. We have a page here about signs they like you, you should give it a read!  You could also just text him and ask to hang out. Worst case scenario he doesn’t like you and you make a new friend. Best case scenario he does like you and you guys flirt and end up dating somewhere down the road.
Going to inspect a house at 2pm today. I’m so nervous because I have to go by myself. It’s a 4 bedroom house which allows pets, but there weren’t any photos online except for the front of the house so I have no idea what the inside looks like. I really hope it’s nice inside. We’ve already applied for it without seeing it, and it’s available on Monday. If we get approved for this house Christmas would be 100x better!
let your gf/bf have friends. stop thinking they have to be around just you ☺️
Sometimes I feel like we want different things for our lives but I’m too afraid to say anything because I don’t want it to be true
Being loyal and serious isn't getting me anywhere in life. sucks 😞😔 why do i get ignored? I'm always comforting you and putting effort but you just ignore me.
It would be a lot easier to win you over if you were shallow.
Why is it is literally impossible to search for anything related to age gap relationships without getting mostly age play blogs and dd/lg blogs… (don’t get me wrong I don’t think there’s anything wrong with that, I would just like to see something else for a change, age play is not really my thing…)
You: happy one month! I know you forgot but I got you a present Significant Other: I totally remembered! Aw you shouldn't have You: it's a magic trick... Ready? POOF you're single
1. Your time is the best gift you can give. – In your relationships with others, nothing you can give is more appreciated than your sincere, focused attention. So don’t listen with an agenda or the intent to reply. Hear what is being said with the intent to truly understand.  2. You have the power to make a big difference. – Everyone in life wants to be loved and accepted. Your greatest achievements in life will be the direct result of finding this love and acceptance within yourself, and radiating it out to those around you.  3. What makes us different is what makes us special. – Don’t be too quick to judge others or bully them for being different. And don’t put up with those who call you “a friend” and then judge and bully you. Let go of the need to prove yourself to everyone else, and you’ll free yourself to accomplish what matters most to you.  4. Love is meant to be shared. – So many people save their ‘loving.’ They consciously avoid putting their heart into their relationships, surrendering, opening up, and sharing, because they want to save it all for the right people (best friends, lovers, etc.) But the problem is when the right people come along they don’t realize it, they don’t know how to open up, and they don’t know anything about the act of loving. 5. You have to love yourself too. – The best thing you can do to improve the quality of your relationships is to work on loving and healing yourself.  6. Praise and recognition matters. – Give genuine praise. This is an investment in them that doesn’t cost you a thing, and the returns can be amazing. Be sure to follow this rule: “Praise in public, penalize in private.”  7. Small gestures of kindness go a long way. – It seems like such a small thing, but in our busy lives we often forget that a kind word, a helping hand, or just a smile and a quick “thank you” can create a bright spot in another person’s life.  8. Without honesty there is no friendship. – Honesty is the first chapter in the book of all wisdom. Honesty is the only path forward. It’s always better to tell people the truth up front. So don’t play games with people’s heads and hearts. Telling the truth and making someone cry is better than telling a lie and making someone smile.  9. Loyalty means the world. – True love and real friendship aren’t about being inseparable. These relationships are about two people being true to each other even when they are separated. When it comes to relationships, remaining faithful is never an option, but an obligation. 10. Reaching out and staying in touch is important. – Stay in touch with those who matter to you because they’re worth the extra effort. Remember, you don’t need a certain number of friends, just a number of friends you can be certain of. Paying attention to these people is always a priority.

life is so short. come spend it with me
How the fuck am I the one that gets cheated on and hurt yet they’re running around with their little fuck buddy and I still get treated like I was the one that acted like an ass?? How do I still fucking care about an insensitive asshole? How the fuck is it I’m the problem when I didn’t act like a bad fucking person until after months and months of lying? Why aren’t they the asshole for pushing me over months and continuing to fucking do so? Fucking slut can fake a whole god damn relationship, can say they want to get married, can say everytime we fight how they won’t wind up with anyone for months. Yet, they basically forgot to end what we had and I had to find out through dumbass friends asking me why she was with him?! But I’m the ass
If you don’t respect a person, how are you capable of ever loving them? Or ever establishing any kind of relationship that is deeper than a mere acquaintanceship? Any relationship must have a foundation of respect and acceptance of the other person and his or her lifestyle decisions. Although two people may not necessarily agree with what the other person is doing, they must be able to look past that and agree to let the other continue without interfering (given that the decision is not harming anyone else). A person must be able to recognize their counterpart as an equal and respect them as an individual who can make his or her own decisions. Without respect, love and relationships below the superficial level are nonexistent. After all, “respect is one of the greatest expressions of love.” -Don Miguel Ruiz
When s/he cannot stand his/her disinterest in him… What’s more relieving!
I want a relationship.  I want to let someone in again.  I want someone to mean something to me again.
Introspection and slight ranting under the cut…had to get it out but feel free to ignore <!-- more --> I think I’ve figured out my problem: I’m lonely. I really, really want a relationship. I’m upset that I haven’t dated anyone since high school, and I feel like that relationship hardly even counts. I’m annoyed that I’m so critical that whenever someone shows interest in me, I find a hundred reasons why I can’t date them, and I push them away. But that’s only half the issue. The bigger part is that I’m angry at myself for feeling those things. I’m angry at myself for wanting a relationship, because I know I don’t NEED one. I’m angry at myself for feeling pressure to date in college. I’m angry at myself for thinking that high standards are a bad thing. I can’t reconcile the fact that I want to date even though I don’t need a boyfriend or a girlfriend to be a complete person. Like the desire to have a romantic/sexual partner is a weakness and a failure of my disposition. Which logically, I know isn’t true, but there’s some part of me that’s too proud to let logic rule here. Because ironically, letting logic rule would mean letting emotion guide me, and…I don’t know how to do that.
Not all relationships are meant to work out. You can try holding on but soon all that will remain is ash and dust.  Not everything that is broken can be fixed. The cracks will always remain.
Slowly realizing more and more I’m wanting something I feel that doesn’t exist anymore… monogamy.. It’s a joke to most these days.. And to me thats truly sad…
I can honestly say I am excited to start this new chapter in my life. I never thought I’d see the day where it would happen for me. It’s baby steps right now before anything else but it does feel like I have made progress. It is a wonderful feeling to feel valued enough to be considered as a key aspect of someone’s life. Sometimes I question myself, thinking am I ready enough but then it’s like, well… am I not ready?  Because I’m not NOT ready. So I’ll see this goes. Right now I feel ‘pleasant’ but i know that when everything sinks in properly I’m going to feel tenfold what I feel now.
When they come up behind you and wrap their arms around you. ❤️
I felt the need to address this subject after all the anon messages I got last night/this morning.  You can be the nicest, most awesome, person ever but if someone isn’t physically attracted to you, they aren’t going to be interested in you. Physical attraction is extremely important. That’s the difference between people who we feel romantic interest in and people who we just consider friends. Of course personality can make or break it for some people and make people become more appealing to us, but that’s not the point. It’s not shady, it’s not selfish, and it’s not sexist. Everyone has preferences and that’s okay. If someone thinks you’re a great person but doesn’t feel the same way romantically, move on. Stop making excuses to be angry at people doing the same thing all of us do.
If there is one thing I learned from all my marriage and family therapy classes, it’s that keeping “emotional score” is an incredibly quick way to end a relationship. If you’re constantly evaluating your own contributions to the world and the people around you based solely on your observations of other people, of course you’re going to look different. But that is NOT a consolation or justification for you to do things you know you shouldnt.  It’s not fair to a human being in a relationship to constantly keep score on all the bad things they’ve done or harmful things they’ve said or mistakes they’ve made. If you sincerely forgive someone, those mistakes cannot be used anymore. You don’t just get to pick what you want to remember, when you want to remember it. That’s not how life works. You learn and progress from your experiences. You don’t keep bringing old things and holding people accountable for things they’ve already done their best to atone for. If it’s something that happened in the past that was already resolved, leave it there. If it never got resolved, resolve it now, and then turn the page immediately and start the next chapter. It’s not okay to only do as much as someone else is doing, just so you don’t have to give your best effort, your 100%. You give it your ALL, ALL the time. Anything else is being selfish in some way. If you truly love someone, you want to be your best for them. You want to do whatever you can to make them happy. You focus on their needs before yours. You don’t constantly evaluate and adjust your own efforts to adjust to theirs. Their 100% might look a little different than yours. That doesn’t make it any better or worse…it just means you’re different people at different mental places. That’s all it means. If you love someone, you do whatever you have to do to be with them in a way that’s healthy for both of you. But you don’t get to force someone to stay in a relationship with you even though you have absolutely no plans in conceding any of the things you know makes them unhappy. If your needs and wants are different, it can be really painful, but you move on. You don’t stay together so that you can both be unhappy for the rest of your lives. You make a mature decision. You act like an adult. You don’t force someone else to lower themselves to your level.
Reading old texts and realising you fucked up something when it could’ve been perfect is fucking heartbreaking
I feel like M could walk into our room and find me wearing nothing but whipped cream and he’d still greet me with an unaffected, “Hey.” I love him more than I’ve ever loved someone, yet I feel so unhappy with him. There is no passion in our relationship. There’s just a lot of work. I’m twenty years old, and I am not ready to settle for someone who doesn’t make me feel like I’m on top of the world.
Guy: What are you up to? ;) Me: Talking to a guy who thinks he's entitled to my anus just because I'm nice to him.
It’s been almost one year since I left my ex-husband, and about 7 months since my divorce was final. Since the divorce was final, there have been a few guys I’d classify as romantic interests, but no one ever became an actual boyfriend. I would wonder if I’d ever find someone, if I made a mistake leaving my ex (even though I knew I didn’t), if something was wrong with me, and at times, I just… View On WordPress
You know when you’re just sitting there reading with someone and you look down at them and see their eyes slowly scanning across the page, and their mouths turned up in the slightest smile, and hear the gentle billowing of their little breaths, and feel their warmth as they lie against you, and just get struck by how much you love every single part of them? That feeling that they are yours and you are theirs and there’s nobody else you would ever rather be with is so cozy and it makes your heart feel all warm. It calms the soul.  That’s one of the things I live for.
That phase when you’re just starting to like someone and the thought of them makes a shiver of happiness shoot through your body

As the soul expands through time, and continues on its journey, relationships tend to fade. Some may stay, but many people you use to connect with may not play as big of a part in your life anymore. Just because a relationship fades does not mean you have to dislike one another. It simply means that at one point, in both your own journey and the other persons journey, your road of life both ran together, but eventually a fork hit your roads and you had to separate onto different paths; so you could both travel a different way that met your souls challenges. You both served as lessons to each others journey at one point, but time may have changed and the lessons you needed to learn from them may have been learned, and the purpose of one another may no longer be needed.  Past relationships, friendships, can still hold a part in your heart. But change is needed for the souls journey. Change, new friendships, new people, new surroundings, it all allows for greater growth of your soul.   ॐ ۞ Stephanie Sonia xoxo♡
However the pain of all of this strengthens my resolve to try new things and hopefully find myself in the process. Goodbye and good riddance.
I don’t want a romantic partner, I want a partner in crime
I’m just sorta speechless. “I never lied to you…” Uh, ok asshole, whatever you say.
Giving gifts is a wonderful way of expressing your love, appreciation or gratitude. It’s a pleasant surprise for the receiver, and makes the giver feel happy to know that they’ve pleased their loved one (unless the gift itself backfired: it happens). Gifts can save your ass when you mess up or disappoint someone, turn somebody’s crappy day around or earn you points with your partner’s friends… View On WordPress
The notion that great marriages are not about comfort and security isn’t news to those of us who have been married or anyone who has ever been in a stagnant relationship.   from Psychology Today - Relationships http://ift.tt/1JeICfr via
I think that once you love someone, even if you don’t realize you love them at the time, you never really stop loving them, not completely. It doesn’t mean you should be with them forever; it doesn’t mean that you’ll have nothing but fond memories of them; it doesn’t mean that you can’t love someone else as much or more in the future. It just means that you love them, that there’s this little nugget like gold in the cavern of your heart that you can pick up and hold now and again, and it never tarnishes. It’s neither good nor bad; it’s not even necessarily meaningful or useful. It’s just there, both a burden and a point of grace. And you carry it with you, not always conscious of it, to the end of your days.
I don’t miss you in the way that you think or may want to believe; but, I miss you because I know it’s truly over and we’re no longer fighting for one another. I don’t want you back if that is what you’re thinking, but I don’t want to say otherwise either. I miss you because I know now that our daughter is to grow up with a broken family that I tried so hard not to let happen. And maybe that is where I went wrong, I was trying so hard to prevent it from happening that I didn’t pay attention to the pain that was brought upon those words.   I only want you to be happy and I know you’re already talking to someone else. Just as I have a boyfriend, it isn’t any more fair if I didn’t wish the same for you to be happy. I just wish it had never came to you moving on, I wanted to believe that when you heard our song that it still bugged you like it once did. I wanted to believe that when you thought of me, you wish you could change the things that can’t be changed and you would come running to me and all would be forgotten.  I don’t care what every one else thought, it’s the fact that you let it all go to your head that hurt the most. It’s been a year since we broke up and I still think about you a lot more than I’d like to admit. It wasn’t until last month that you began to pop into my mind more than I wanted.  It’s rough because this is the first year in three years that I’ve spent Thanksgiving and Christmas away from you. I can still remember when we had broken up in 2013 and right when I had thought that I had moved on from you after our last conversation, you had followed me outside at your grandparents home and then you asked me, “What are we doing?” And I didn’t know what to say, so I walked away and you grabbed my arm and told me to go to the tool shed with you. We sat inside for about 5 minutes before you said anything and I had began crying because we were about to go court over our daughter.  You kneeled in front of me and then held my face up to look at you and wiped my tears away. You asked me again, “What are we doing?” and I smirked and told you that I didn’t know anymore, then you said you loved me and didn’t want to be away from me anymore, you couldn’t live without me and our daughter.  The truth is, you’ve lived a year without us. Only trying to make me feel sorry for you never seeing your daughter when it was a two way street. I had been played when you said you wanted to have our daughter, it was only sex between us, there was no connection or love anymore. That was because I realized that you could live without me because a man who says that the woman he’s with is the woman of his dreams, he doesn’t give up trying to make the relationship work, he fights for it.  How could I go from being the woman of your dreams to nothing more than another voice to you? I changed so much over this last year for me to become a better person and mother, only to have us agree that there was no chance of us anymore. I wanted you to say that you did want another chance, even if you said not right now. But it’s not what I got, it isn’t even close. Now you’ve moved on and you’re happy, and I’m happy for you. I just wish it were me that could make you happy.  It’s been a year and it’s almost as if my tears were still fresh. This is the first time in six months that I have cried over you and it still feels like a fresh wound. I’m sorry, for everything. I sincerely am and I wish you the best.  With love,  Patricia.
I lay in the shower, drops patterning across my face as the sedatives start to work their magic. No matter the distance, you couldn’t be further from me than you are now. I’ve gotten used to it for the most part, but that night, the wound was ripped open again. Just like that, I found myself unable to stem the flood of memories made in your name. Though thoroughly dysfunctional, it was the only non-abusive relationship I’ve ever had. With both of us having PTSD, we never really had a chance. I never had any illusions about that. I loved you with everything I had but love isn’t enough. So I lay there, tears mixing with the spray. I allowed myself to feel, to wish, to reminisce, but not to hope. What’s done is done. Grief is the risk you take when you allow yourself to really love someone else and I cannot–will not–ever go back. I could pick up the phone, if I really want to know why I’ve been thinking of you the last few days, but I won’t. PTSD is a dark pool in my mind, where all the restless dead thrash about. In this way, I can never really move on from much of anything; the past won’t stay where it belongs. So I’ll think of you, and allow myself to work through this pain just like I do with every other difficult experience I’ve had. And I’ll play that song, the one that always makes me think of you–of us. I’ll allow myself to dream of what was. I’ll continue to hope you find yourself out of the living hell that is PTSD. And I’ll hope for myself a little, too.
Single and ready for Pringles
“I gotta be honest, I just don’t think we’re meant to be.” On Monday, my boyfriend said those words to me and part of my heart sank. Yes, I had a feeling they may come sooner or later, or that I would have ended the relationship, but it still hurt to hear them come out of his mouth. We see each other almost every day, and he is one of my best friends on my college campus.    The thing is, he was right. We both have the same idea that when we date someone, we eventually hope to marry that person. This relationship started out great, and I honestly had a feeling that he may be “the one”, but the more time you spend with someone, the more you get to see their real side.    Let me share something that I think is important to think about. If you are in a relationship with someone that does not encourage you, express interest in your life, or help you grow as a person or in your walk with God, what is keeping you with that person? Is it fear of letting that person go and then never finding another one? Do you not want to hurt him/her? Why do we stay in relationships like that? How amazing it is to think about how God has a plan for us that is better than we can ever imagine. We must trust in His plan and believe that he wants what is best for us. Why should we settle when we could be missing out on someone/something far, far greater?  I am not going to say that dating this guy was a mistake, or waste of time, because it already happened and now it is part of my story. I believe that no relationship is a waste of time. We can learn and grow in our own way from each experience we have with another person, if we choose to.    We had a fun time. He is funny, entertaining, and he’ll be good for a different girl some day. I learned about myself and I learned about what I do and do not want in a husband. I learned that boundaries are important, and that communication is key. I learned that when people can’t be there for me, God always will. I also learned that singleness is indeed a blessing, even if we hear that and find it hard to believe. I am thankful that God gave me this time with this guy, even if we were not meant to be together anymore. I don’t want to be sad because it’s over; I am just looking forward to whatever life looks like in the next few years.   After we talked a bit about why we should not continue dating, I felt that God was telling me to pray for him, so I asked him if I could, and he said yes.I thanked God for our experiences together, and that he had brought us to each other at this time in our lives. I prayed that he would do well on his final exams and have a great Christmas vacation with his friends and family. After that, he asked if he could pray for me and it was an awesome moment. Even though I would miss parts of our relationship, I couldn’t help but feel joy in my heart that God gave us this special moment together.    I praise God for getting me through this week, even though I’ve had a weird feeling in my chest these past few days. I’m thankful for friends that encourage me and care for me.    If you are going through heartbreak or have recently ended a relationship, I encourage you to try to focus on the positives rather than the negatives. Don’t be afraid to cry to someone at first; it’s healthy. Then remember that God loves you more than any human ever could and that He has a great plan for you. I know that is easier said than done, but remember you are loved and that the way one person treats you is not reflective on how much you are worth… Because to God, you are worth sending His own son to die on the cross.
How do you build trust in an era of distrust? Use this simple way to start.   from Psychology Today - Relationships http://ift.tt/1UF5MSC via
When Riley and I first met, I didn’t know what to think. It was lunchtime and I was at band camp, sitting by myself because everyone else at the table had already finished eating and left. I started listening in on the guys at the table next to me, because I was too scared to talk to them or introduce myself or anything. So I listened, and laughed when they made jokes. The Band captain, Tito, was sitting at that table and noticed that I was laughing with them, so he called me over to sit with them. They all introduced themselves, and when it got to Riley, I had this really weird feeling in my stomach when he looked at me. I knew it was the beginning of a crush, but he was an older guy, and I was this lame wannabe emo kid that drank too much and cried even more. I actually didn’t end up dating him first that year. I dated a guy named Travis, that I sort of manipulated into liking me, because I demanded to know if he thought I was cute. When we dated, all he wanted to do was make out on the bus (he moaned when he kissed me which was weird but I went with it) and feel me up. He tried to get in my pants one time, but I told him no. (Later, when Riley was asking about me after Travis and I had broken up, Travis told him that “You only have to say that you love her to get in her pants.” So fuck that guy). Riley and I started texting around his birthday, but he was dating another girl at the time (it wasn’t going well). He invited me to his birthday party, but my overprotective mother didn’t let me go, so he made up a “jam session” last minute for the next day that I somehow convinced my mom to let me go to.  My grandfather died in October of that year, the day after Travis asked me out. I still ache inside for Papa, he was a better father than my father, or any of my cousins fathers, for that matter. He was the guy you could talk to, that didn’t tell you it was just hormones when you told him you didn’t feel right, he sat you down on the swing that he made for his children and told you to just let it out. He’d tickle your feet if you were laying in front of his chair, he’d fall asleep in the middle of the day, he’d tell you to fake an illness if you really didn’t want to go to church that morning, and he’d say, “Well SOMEONE has to take care of this poor child!” And it would always be him because my grandma never missed church. Ever. I miss him to this day, and while I have a few regrets, my biggest is that he never got to meet Riley, that he’ll never get to walk me down the aisle, that my first dance won’t be with him. After Travis and I broke up, I drank a lot more. It had only been a month after my grandpas passing, and I had fractured my ankle in November, so I was on pain medicine too. Riley and his girlfriend broke up, because she wanted to drink and screw other guys (he doesn’t drink or do drugs and he isn’t promiscuous), and I found out when he told all of his friends in the back of the band locker room. I remember getting so excited that I said “yes!” a little too loudly, because one of the guys (Patrick) heard me and shook his head and winked at me. Riley and I texted every day, leading up to when we told each other that we liked each other. I remember telling him not to like me, not to fall in love with me, because I knew I was a big mess that he was going to have to help clean up in order for me to function like a normal human being. He laughed and told me not to tell him what to do (it’s a joke between us now). The night Riley and I found out that the crushes went both ways, we were at a football game. It was a playoff game, so we didn’t have to March, and everyone was in jeans and t shirts. I was still hurting because of my ankle, and on my way up the stands I banged it on one of the seats. One of the people in my section gave me some really strong pain meds and I was already kinda tipsy from alcohol and so that night, I was very very confident. Riley and I were texting in the stands and talking, we liked a lot of the same bands, and I found out he was a junior (I thought he was a sophomore lol). It gets a little hazy for me, but our texting became a little bit of sexting, which ended pretty quickly. I remember telling him to meet me somewhere at school so we could make out, but he ended up not being able to because his ride was leaving immediately after the game. So I met him in the parking lot, and I gave the people in his group hugs, and he was like, “what about me?” And I gave him a hug, and THATS when I knew that this boy was different.  You know how in books, they talk about soul mates like when they touch it’s all electrical and shit? When Riley and I hugged, it was different. Sure, we’ve had our electrical moments, but that first hug, the first time we’d ever touched, was like a mixture of everything just quieting and butterflies flying in my stomach. His hugs are what keep me grounded, they make everything inside me just silence for a little while, and I know that’s where I need to be. Riley and I started dating December 1st, 2011, when he asked me out as I was getting on my bus. Our first kisses were little ones, just small pecks that made me feel like I could fly. I didn’t care if that was it, it was what I wanted. Riley and I talked about what being straight edge was, and I went cold turkey on drinking the day he asked me out (it was a kinda scary night) and I haven’t drank since. He was there for me when I told him about how I was anxious or sad or didn’t want to live, he said all the right things and kept me going. I remember telling him that I was falling in love with him, because I was too scared to tell him that I was already in love with him, in fear that he didn’t feel the same and would leave me.  One night, we went to the movies, and after, we went to Burger King. In the parking lot, instead of just going to his side of his car, he came to my side and and took my hands and said, “Dammit, Izzy, I can’t wait anymore. I love you.” I have always been afraid that if I say I love you, it won’t mean anything. But something in me that night just surged out of me and I told him I loved him too, and he kissed me for a little while, then we drove home. He told me he had told his friend that he was in love with me a couple weeks after we started dating.  Riley and I have been through so much. We were each other’s firsts. We had a pregnancy scare. He kept me breathing through high school, when the stress was so overwhelming that I couldn’t get out of bed most mornings. We stopped having sex for a while because of relationship problems, and we’ve had more than our fair share of arguments.  For me, my problems have always been hurting our relationship. I’ve been working on them, and I know how much of a strain it puts on Riley, I know that there have been times where he’s wanted to leave me because that would be the easier route, but he hasn’t. I love him more than anything, and I don’t want to continue to put him under this much stress for much longer. I’ve gone to counseling, I’m going to be medicated, and I’m learning ways to cope with my reactions to things. I saw fireworks for the first time last night without having a panic attack. I can tell when Riley’s actually angry at his parents when he’s being grumpy with me. I’m more open with him, I’ve moved in with him. He’s my better half, and while I’m getting better for me, I’m getting better for him too. He deserves to have a partner who knows how to act in social situations, who doesn’t get angry over a facial expression that they read way too much into, who can deal with him rolling over in the middle of the night away from them. I love him, and so I’ve been trying to be the person HE needs.  Last night, Riley and I had a long talk about how my problems are affecting our relationship, and I promised him that I’m working on it. But, if he leaves me because my problems get to be too much for him to handle, I can’t say that I blame him. I love him, and he will always be the guy who saved me countless times, the guy who I loved more than I’ve ever loved anything, but I will let him go if that’s what he chooses. It’ll hurt like hell, but if it’s what he wants, I’ll respect that.
…from posting about my magazines to talk about something a bit more serious…trust in a marriage. Without going in to too many personal details, there has been a ‘compromise’ of sorts in this area in my marriage. My husband betrayed my trust, and I betrayed his…so can that be fixed? Perhaps the better question is, do both parties want it to be fixed…. For me, I have been given no choice. He said that he has not done anything else that I would consider a betrayal of trust, and that it is up to me to beleive him or not. I have to say, I don’t know if I agree with that….shouldn’t people prove they are trsutworthy? For my part, money is an issue. I pay the bills and handle the finances. I don’t mind doing this, it makes me feel useful, on the other hand my husband does not believe that I do a good job here, and I admit in the past I have not. I have gone through ‘episodes’ (for lack of a better word) where I used ‘retail therapy’ as a way to make myself feel better. I was made at my husband, let me buy a new shirt. My kids did something wrong, let me buy a pair of sunglasses. Don’t get me wrong…I don’t do this at the expense of our mortgage or car payments, I am not looking at all our new stuff in the dark because I forgot to pay the electric bill. On the other hand, my husband makes enough that we should have some savings, and we have none. I will admit that I am part of the problem, on the other hand, I admit that it pisses me off that my husband takes NO responsibility for anything. Is that my fish tank? Is that my motorcycle in the garage? My HUGE TV? (OK, I admit it…I LOVE that TV more than him and it is easy on my bad eyes…) the point is, we both like nice things..and IF I tell him…can we wait until the next time you get paid? Or we don’t have the money right now? I get dirty looks…so, do I stick to my guns, or do I give in because I don’t want him to be mad at me. I admit it…99.9% of the time..I give in. So, we got a nice tax return..and I coached again this past winter. Is it better to pay off the credit card that is charging us interest? To get caught up on all the bills and start fresh? I thought so, but I am wrong. I admit that perhaps I am not a very trustworthy person…I live in fear of disappointing my husband, so I do things my way and figure I will explain them later. On the other hand, I am not given a chance to prove that I am doing what I said I would do..I am just told I am full of crap (though that isn’t the word that was used). Which makes me defensive, and frankly it does make me feel like crap..so again, do I ignore how I feel and just say, “hey, look…YOU said you trusted me to do it…so trust me.” And then ignore the dirty looks and the snide comments, or do I once again, cry and say I am sorry, forgive me, forgive me. Perhaps part of my frustration comes from the fact, that I am not supposed to say anything about his breach of my trust, I can not question him on that without starting a fight, and I admit this bothers me. My mouth is to be kept shut. Well, this time I KNOW I am doing what I said I would…and frankly, I am tired to apologizing. So, I will do what I continue to do, and get things done. And let’s face it…he will get his fish tank stuff, and we will go on vacation, whether I feel like doing it or not. (OK…OK…perhaps all of that sounded harsh, and angry, and if I am being honest…in a way I feel harsh and angry, but I got to vent somewhere!)
I want to take a moment to write about something I don’t often see. Men and women in love will often wax poetic about their mates eyes, their smile, their hair, etc…but what about their hands? It was perhaps five or six days ago, I was up nursing our infant….around 2 am in the morning. I was exhausted, worn out, and my husband rolled over and put his hand on my knee. He gently rubbed his hand over my leg and left his hand there. I looked at it and surprisingly felt tears well up. I figured I was just tired and therefore over emotional, but I took a breath and looked at his hand again. Those hands have helped me through three births, they soothed my brow when I didn’t think I could push anymore. Almost ten years later he will still reach back while we are shuffling five kids through the mall, almost as if to say…I know you are there, and I will never forget or leave you. My husband is a tall man…almost 6’3” (though he swears he is shrinking) his hands are a suitable size to his frame, and yet he will hold our tiny baby as gently as if he were holding an egg. Those hands have soothed countless tummyaches and headaches, poured cup after cup of juice, and changed tiny diapers. My husband has amazing eyes….a sort of sea green that will change from blue to green depending on what he wears. His smile is equally amazing, and occasionally he will laugh with abandon, throwing his head back and smacking his hand on his thigh (don’t get me started on those!), but his hands deserve equal attention because it is those hands that will carry me through the years when I need to be carried.
I have met men that are breast men. I have met men that are butt men, leg men, etc. I even had a friend in high school that was all about the hair a woman had. But I only met one man that was a ‘me’ man. Let me explain: Most of the time I will look at my husband and see the man that I adore. I can be mad as hell at him, but he is still the man that makes my heart skip a beat, that makes a tear well up in my eye as he plays with our three month old, but every once in awhile I will look at him and think, “I don’t deserve this man.” When I am feeling melancholy or morose, I will turn to my husband and ask him questions whose answers I KNOW will cheer me up. I believe it was a Thursday, just your average Thursday, and I was sick. I felt horrible. I was sure my head was going to explode, my throat felt like someone had rubbed it raw with heavy duty sandpaper, and I knew I looked the part. I got out of bed, and marched into the bathroom wearing my nursing bra and well worn boy shorts. I did my business and came out of the bathroom to see my husband motioning me over to him. I smiled and walked around to his side of the bed, sat down and leaned over him, waiting to be enveloped in his sleepy warmth. He hugged me too him and rubbed my back, as I felt his hand creeping lower, I turned to him and asked if he was an ass man. His reply: “I’m a you man.” I thought it was sweet at the time, and showed him my appreciation. But later that day, as I was in the kitchen I thought about what he said, and it struck me…that was possibly the sweetest thing he had ever said to me. Oh, he has told me he loved me many times…and I hold every single time dearly. He has told me I was beautiful, that I was smart, powerful, etc. But in that one short sentence he said all of that and more. He told me he loved me, that I was smart, that I was beautiful, but also that he accepted my faults, and dealt with them as best he could. He told me he remembered our past and was looking forward to our future. He was a “me” man. I hope he knows “I’m a him woman.”
Are not doing it to spite a lover. Are not doing it because their past/current relationships aren’t great.  Are not doing it as a grudge.  Are not doing it because they can’t get the one they want. Some people don’t like love with rules or expectations.  Some people feel uncomfortable with monogamy.  Some people don’t need a title to fall in love.  Some people just want to love.
When you still have feelings for your ex.. And so many flash back come to mind.  I can’t handle it. I want him out of my mind.
I could actually feel your fingers laced with mine. I felt my fingers through your hair as I placed my hand at the base of your neck. I could feel our legs intertwine, the skin of our calves melting together. I felt safe with your arms wrapped around me, until it was all interrupted by the worst phone call I could ever imagine. A call that would ruin my family. Thankfully, I woke up. I was both relieved and disappointed at the same time. Wanting you for so long has made missing you unbearable, but being with you in reality just as miserable. When you text me I will not reply. Not because I don’t want to breathe in the scent of your body, but because if that phone call had not just been in my dreams I would no longer have the will to live and I would blame you wholeheartedly.
Not only are society’s outdated beliefs changing about the “sanctity” of relationships, how we behave and define ourselves in them is also shifting. Whether you were the first one in your family to move in with your sweetheart prior to marriage, or you’ve been in a loving same-sex partnership for decades, or have elected to bow out of monogamous relationships all together, you are likely a completely different person than you were when you had your first date. Over the course of our lives, and particularly during our cosmic shift, our maturity and spiritual evolution have expanded us beyond the parameters of who we thought we were or believed we should be. Not only can this be disconcerting inwardly, it can be strenuous on a relationship. <!-- more --> Though all healthy relationships grow and change as the individuals do, the more subtle and profound spiritual transformations we experience can leave us feeling indefinable and, therefore, incapable of upholding our previous roles in our ongoing relationships. Our expectations begin to shift as well, even though we may not be able to articulate our new perspectives to those we endear. Instead, we end up feeling lost and wondering how to relate in ways we barely understand – ways that honor who we are while keeping our loyalty and love intact. Imagine telling your husband, “Honey, I love you dearly, but I need my space to do some deep inner searching. It may take me a year or two, and my intention is to continue to love you, but we’ll see what happens when I emerge. I’ll be sleeping in the room down the hall until then.” Ha! Can you imagine how well that would go over!? Yet, it may be the most honest and important sentence you utter to him as you discover your true self. During this discovery period of “Who am I really?” we may realize that we have always identified ourselves in regards to each of our relationships – daughter or son, sister or brother, friend, companion, beloved, wife or husband, parent, grandparent and so on. What often happens after the dissolution of an important relationship is we redefine who we are. Yet, who we truly are has nothing to do with our relationships. Our true essence experiences our relationships as an exchange of energy and an opportunity to discover “other” and “self” and how the two seemingly separate beings relate. Our essence has no need to have our relationships define us. Our ego, on the other hand, uses relationships as the foundation of its structure. Thus as we embark, consciously or not, on the journey to our essential self-one of the most intense shifts we encounter happens in our relationships. At some point, the Universe seems to bring us face-to-face with our beliefs about our identity as reflected in our cherished relationships – not to mention how we behave in them. For example, do you consider yourself a “good partner?” Those two words alone create such strong parameters which are fashioned from our beliefs; beliefs about what each word means individually, as well as when coupled together. Moreover, they are infused with all the stories associated with “good partner” from generations past. If you believe you are a good partner, or want to uphold that commitment, then anything you do that is outside of that structure of beliefs has the potential to shake the foundation of your identity as well as the relationship you want to be a “good partner” in. Once shaken, we begin to question ourselves, our worth, our relationships and fear can set in. From fear the ego goes to fight or flight, right? Arguments erupt, blame flies, hurt happens, and retreats to safety become inevitable. But from what are we really seeking safety? Ironically, as we desperately desire love in each of our relationships, the tenderness its purity offers our hearts can be too intense for our fragile egoic selves. In our efforts to feel safe, we retreat from the love we crave. Yet in our collective awakening, it is true love we are revealing and so begins a deliberate dissolving of the protective ego – a releasing of all the identities of who we thought we were that keep us from experiencing it. So is it possible to release these identities and keep our beloved relationships? Absolutely. Millions of people on the planet are experiencing great inner shifts at this time. If we understand this on a global scale, we realize that our inner currents are ebbing and flowing, to some degree, with the collective tide. Rather than retreating in isolation and fear, we can empower ourselves with self-compassion and make room for ourselves to grow. By giving yourself permission to discover what’s beneath the masks of relationship-defined identities, you will likely need some space, both inwardly and in your relationships. For example, inner space would mean making room for a shift in your beliefs. “How does ‘good’ relate to my life, and what other definitions can it imply for me?” Space in your relationships may mean setting boundaries so you can evaluate how you relate to others and how you let them define you. “What if we choose not to have sex so I can practice retaining my own energy and not fall into the habit of pleasing you?” And what about new relationships? Can they really form healthily in spite of all the changes we are going through? Of course, they can. As each ego identity – or mask – releases, you change and become more of your authentic self. For a moment, imagine yourself spinning round and round at a masquerade ball with a room full of potential partners who are also twirling. The music stops and you find yourself facing another dancer. The two of you instantly connect because you are each wearing similar masks. Perhaps you share a few dances together. Then, the spinning resumes and your mask flies off only to reveal another mask. When the music stops again, what is the likelihood of you facing or finding the same dance partner? It’s possible, but if you are seeking someone whose mask is no longer recognizable or has been lost altogether, it makes the “match game” quite difficult, doesn’t it? Yet, if we seek to connect with those without masks and have released our own, the relations we create are founded on authenticity, rather than superficial matches. As long as we are hooked into relationships that are dependent on another person’s ego-created identity or our projections, we will not only risk the loss of the relationship as we or our partners grow, we are missing a profound opportunity to connect deeply with the other person’s true essence… which is pure Love. More significantly, our masks and projections will keep us from our own essence and experiencing the Love within and around us at all times. When we reveal and tap into our true essence, we discover a relationship with life that is unmatched.   In our relationships, today more than ever, it is essential that we regularly evaluate our beliefs, the various ways we identify ourselves, our projections we place on others and our expectations. Love is trying to reveal itself to us. Likely it is trying to touch your heart through your relationships. The question is, are you willing to expose yourself and allow it in?  By: Veronica Lee

I remember when we went to Yankee Candle and I held a mistletoe scented candle over our heads. You rolled your eyes and grinned, lips soft on mine. I remember when we went to McDonald’s and you couldn’t finish your habanero burger because it was too spicy. I remember peppery kisses in your car after. I remember every time we kissed just to make my sister blush. I remember curling up in our friend’s basement while everyone else hid their eyes from that horror movie (it wasn’t very scary, but I suppose my opinion doesn’t count because I had my eyes on you the whole time). I remember each note we passed in French class, in Law Education, in Biology. I remember our first date and how we missed each other’s mouths, and how giddy I felt when we tried again and it was the most beautiful thing I’d ever felt. I remember when we sat in the Drama room, curled into each other while the teacher pretended not to notice, and you said we’d be this way forever. But it wasn’t forever. In the scheme of high school romances perhaps, but it wasn’t forever. And it’s been forever since that last kiss but I feel it on my mouth and in my soul. It’s been forever since we cried and apologized, forever since we spent Valentine’s together as friends instead of what we used to be. It’s been forever since we walked across the stage and received our diplomas, forever since you went to the opposite end of the state. It’s been forever since I last saw you, forever since you held me as I cried over something stupid. Everyone I go out with now gets unfairly compared to you. The bar is set; maybe no one will reach it. Because you’re as close to perfect as I know. As I could ever know. (Our lows were low, but our highs were higher than Icarus ever flew.)

Gee, guys and gals out there. Have you ever found that special person who is down to earth, really cool, and someone you’ve been on some of the wackiest adventures with. Someone who has shown you attention, reliability, loyalty, and walked with you during the good and bad times? A friend who has stood out against the masses and caught your eye? A friend you’ve realized you have feelings for? And when you admitted to having feelings for them they totally “Friend Zone” you? Happened to me plenty of times.   The “Friend Zone” is a topic that’s been debated upon since forever. The Friend Zone is a situation in which one friend garners feelings for another in which the other shows no interests or is comfortable with that person’s station in their life so the feelings aren’t reciprocated. It is one of the worst situations to be in and can literally tear even the best of friendships apart.   Now I realize that I’m a bit bitter over this subject. I’ve been Friend Zoned a lot in my life and it is most unfortunate because I’ve allowed it to ruin some of my friendships.    The thing about the Friend Zone is that the person has to decide whether they want to continue to be that person’s friend. I advocate that if someone likes their friend, tell them and if the feelings aren’t reciprocated then immediately cast that person off. It doesn’t matter how long they’ve been friends or how good friends they are. Immediately cut them from your life. It sounds harsh but think about it. Some people when they’re rejected can immediately stop liking a person so it’s not a lingering issue. However, there are some people (I count myself as one of these people) who can’t just drop feelings. So why not drop the person.   See people attribute relationships to the level of confidence a person has. They also attribute leadership skills to the level of confidence a person has also. I question this because confidence doesn’t tell a person if someone is relationship material or a leader. Relationships are suppose to keep getting better and better but how can you feel the need to keep getting better if you’re overly confident. And let’s admit it, a confident person won’t have that same drive to keep getting better and better. Also, some of the greatest leaders throughout time weren’t overly confident. They questioned themselves, they questioned their actions. The people around them made them confident.   Should friends try for a relationship if one is feeling the other? That’s up for debate. I personally feel they should. I mean why not? See, the problem with this situation isn’t the fact that the friend being liked doesn’t see a possible relationship with the admirer, it’s usually the fact that the friend being liked doesn’t see them self sleeping with the admirer.    I’ve heard something that made me rethink the whole situation when it comes to having female friends. Just because you’re nice doesn’t mean they should like you. I simply don’t have any female friends nor do I want any. When it comes to the whole Friend Zone situation I think it’s better to avoid the situation rather than having to deal with it. But hey, I’ll write more on this.

Heartbreak mercenaries The Breakup Shop don’t need courage to end a relationship, $10 will do nicely.  Gavin Rogers/REX/Shutterstock Well, they say there’s a market for everything and The Breakup Shop are proudly filling the end-of-love niche. Their website jovially offers to “handle the messy work of the breakup so you can spend more time swiping right.”  For as little as $10 the company will terminate your relationship via a third party text. thebreakupshop.com/thebreakupshop.com/REX/Shutterstock Too harsh? Why not spend $20 sending the exact same message by post? Perks of the “Standard Letter” include: high quality paper and the opportunity to use the companies return address “in case you don’t want your ex to know where you live now.” thebreakupshop.com/REX/Shutterstock If you want to make things a wee bit more personal (and why wouldn’t you?) $30 will buy you a 300 word custom letter created through a consultation with the breakup team. $29 will employ the services of the “Breakup Phone Call” in which a standardised breakup message will be mouth-delivered to your soon-to-be erstwhile love. Does this involve a script being read down the phone? Your guess is as good as ours. Why not say it with (really cheap) flowers? The $48 “Breakup Text + Bouquet” bundle includes one standard breakup text plus a bunch of daisies and carnations. Unfortunately this option is only available to heartless customers in Canada and the US. For customers nursing a guilty conscience, the site offers a range of gifts for exes which include: wine glasses, cookies and Netflix subscriptions. Breakups can take between three days to two weeks to deliver, though a ‘rush’ service is available on all options (excluding the cheap flowers).

Hello everyone  So most people ask me why I stayed for too long 4 years of continuous mental break down ,being depressed, broken promises with the person i considered my soul mate here we go; yeh I stuck around because I loved him and still do (from a distance) and I stuck around because I gave him the benefit of the doubt and I stuck around because I knew that if he stopped drinking and after some time and hard work life would be better for all of us,I stuck around because I wanted to marry him,what has marriage got to do with it any way?Then I realized that I could be sticking around for another 20 years or it might only be 1 month but I just couldnt take any more chances and I was exhausted, we are all in the same situation or have been in the same situation dealing with an addict and that situation is very unpleasant,unfair and dangerous. I decided to leave him to his bottle and other women and I am so much more better for it and I encourage others to do the same.  Love a soul in search♥️
You wrote about me for years - in such great detail, I could even recall every moment as I read all the way down the page and on to the next. But you changed even when I thought you never would and you took that red piece of rubber and erased me from your book. However for me, I had a whole novel about you. But when we came to an end, I couldn’t bare to erase it all, it was impossible - my tears simply washed it away. My fault for thinking you were a permeant part of my life using ink to tell our story. Once washed away, it left many smeared, but blank pages. That upsetter me at first, but just because you have a bunch of blank pages doesn’t mean your life is empty. Soon, I began to write again - filling those pages with new experiences, making new memories, and forgetting about the very pain my distant story of us once caused me. I’m only left with the dry, smeared, and illegible ink to remember the past which with each passing day becomes hazier. Now I don’t regret me and him. I’m quite grateful that “we” happened. I discovered how much love I’m capable of.  Years pass by and my book is almost full - I come across the last page to find not a blank page, but aa poem he wrote to me all those years ago. At the end of that poem, he had written: “…and if you ever find yourself missing me and can’t seem to stop thinking of us, just go to our favorite place. That’s where I’ll be waiting always.” As I finish, tear drops have already fallen on the page. I knew exactly where he was talking about, even after so much time has gone by. Just for a place to reminisce, I drive down to that little park where he first told me he loved me. For the first time in so long, I’m back at our favorite place - I find myself under the largest tree in the park, smiling and looking up at the sky. Happiness is the only thing I knew here. I admire all of the familiar features of the park; like the beautiful red rose bushes that bloom perfectly every year, the tall and elegant French-styled light posts, and the bridge which arched over clear and crisp water filled with fish, frogs, ducks, lily pads, and other small organisms. The bridge is my favorite spot of all of the park. That is where he told me he loved me.  I walk over to the bridge, still as breathtaking as ever, but what I found on that bridge was not at all what I was expecting. A familiar physique leaned over the side, watching the water flow by and enjoying nature. “It’s you.” I said in bewilderment. He turned around and simply said, “I thought you’d never come.” Unable to speak, I walk over to him and he embraced me just like I remember - warm and tender, yet strong and masculine. We talk about how we’ve been and what we’ve accomplished in life so far. To my surprise, we both are single and when I asked why he was here, his reply immediately brought all of the feelings I had for him back. “I come here everyday, hoping that you’d be standing right here.” he admitted. I couldn’t believe it. He begins telling me that losing me was the worst decision he’d ever made and he couldn’t be more sorry that it took him this long to realize. Then, he suggests we go out for lunch to continue catching up and at this point, I’m still in disbelief. “What do you say?” he nervously asks. I look at him blankly thinking if I should agree or not.  He adds, “And maybe I can finish that poem I started in your book…” “I would love that.” I gladly answer. - thelastenvelope
He says forever and always like he means it, Like he will cherish our love, Like he will love on, And my heart started on fire,  Because now I can move on.
I knew who he was in high school BUT never met him. He was a well known guy amongst the “asian” clique. I was a freshmen cheerleader. We had common friends but never crossed paths until the end of 2014 & the beginning of 2015. I don’t know what it was that urged me to add him on Instagram, but I did. He said at first he was following me back but then unfollowed me because I didn’t like his pictures. Not true; I liked them! Which is why he started following me again!  Mid December of 2014 I see my phone light up and it’s his Instagram name popping up multiple times saying “rudeboy808s liked your picture” and a minute later more notifications popped up.  I was single and had just learned how to be happy on my own and just be me. In my head I was thinking, “oh boy, another guy liking all my photos. Is he interested in the photos or the girl in the photo?” I commented on one of my photos directed towards him saying, “Thanks for that liking streak. I hope you and your daughter are doing well!” He never commented back. Then I think I added him on SnapChat & we started sending each other snaps & chatted. I remember he sent me a message and said, “You’re cute 😊” Not going to lie that made me smile. It felt good to receive compliments. Chatting on snapchat was kind of hard and that’s when he suggested, “chatting on here is hard, mind if I get your number?” Slick move handsome guy! He sent me his number and I sent him mine.  We started texting a lot, every day & this was still in December. I remember he’d send me pictures of him at work and I’d send him pictures of me and my books and coffee. He even texted me saying, “I wanna know more about you” & so there it began. My heart opened up for him although I feared of a broken heart from him. We both had a extremely rough & painful year in 2014, so we both agreed it was “rebuild mode” for us the upcoming year. He loved working out and so did I, so we planned on meeting up one day to work out together. It was January 6th. I was nervous but I finally got to meet him. When I first saw him, again, there was something about him I couldn’t put my finger on. I felt like I had known him for years & I don’t know, I just felt really different with him. He is very handsome with nice muscles. He is easy to be myself with & he is funny! He was very motivating during our workout and I loved that. After our workout he asked, “where we going for breakfast?” In my head I was like “oh, it doesn’t end here huh?” We decided to go to Black Bear Diner. He drove his black challenger and I followed. We talked about our history & got to know each other more. When breakfast was coming to an end, I offered to pay but he declined. We hugged in the parking lot and planned to see each other the next day.  Fast forward to almost a year now, boy has it been one heck of a year. Not only was I blessed with him but also his absolutely beautiful and intelligent babygirl. I always told myself I couldn’t or wouldn’t date a man who had children. For some reason, I believe God’s reason – I felt different with him & it wasn’t due to the circumstances that him and his babygirl had faced the prior year. It was something more, something bigger, something that only God could explain. I feel whole with them. I feel complete. In the beginning of the year, he had asked me to stay by his side no matter what & so I said, “I promise to stay by your side no matter how hard the storm hits.” I mean it & always will, forever.  You see, it didn’t take me long to realize that he is the one I’ve been searching for my whole life. It didn’t take me long to know how I truly felt about him.  I know that I love him with ALL OF MY HEART & SOUL. And God knows that I absolutely adore and love this man & babygirl with all of the life that I have in me. I will do anything in my power to make sure no harm comes his way & babygirl’s way.  I truly believe God planned “us”. It took me 2 heartbreaks & self-destruction & took him 1 incredible heartbreak & loss for “us” to finally cross paths.  I believe we strengthen each other & give each other the courage to feel, to trust, to love, & to have FAITH again. He is “the one” & it would be an honor for me to spend the rest of my life with him by my side.
After today I won’t see my boyfriend for over 10 days. Then we see each other for a week, then after the 4th January it’ll be another 3 weeks. Wow. Just wow.
what makes something real? to see it or to feel it? because I’ve felt God, but never seen Him. & I’ve seen love but never felt it.  these are the things I think about at 3AM.
Christmas Day This is my first Christmas with my new partner, we have been together for almost a year and have recently moved in together. I am really excited about our first Christmas together but all we do is fight about what we are going to do on Christmas day. My parents split up many… Relationship Dilemmas was originally published on The Spark
I don’t wanna jinx it by putting it on blast, but… You ever actually spend time with someone and each day spent slowly opens your eyes? Opens your eyes to the fact that who you needed came in someone totally unexpected.  I think the 1st of my many dreams are coming true.  I just gotta keep enduring life until the end.
i either give too much attention or too little there is no in between
I am like that dress in the closet which my owner bought and forgot and right now she is out shopping - getting some new dresses.
I’m thankful for my Lord, love, and blessings. I’m gonna be positive because being faithful in prayer is what I should do… what I want to do
There’s absolutely no doubt in my mind that I’ll always love him - I’ll love him for the way that he made me laugh, smile, and how in small ways he taught me how to love myself. Meeting him in the chaos of one time of my life and falling in love with him in the following calm of my life… was the greatest time of my life. I wouldn’t have it any other way.  I was so damn happy and it was lovely.
The worst feeling is when you realize that it’s too late.
You made me believe, behave, see, feel, think, talk, and do certain things a specific way for 3 ½ years, I used to think that it was completely normal, until I finally got out. That is when I realized all those things weren’t me, but what you wanted me to be.
I want to be yours again so fucking bad I want to touch your hair kiss your forehead  hug you  I want to sleep with my head resting on your chest listening to your heartbeat  my hand in yours  I want to see you sleeping  I want to hear your voice  I want to be yours more than anything  ..
I met this guy and long story short we dated but we broke up rather quickly. He was a marine, a dick to people but treated me like a princess. He wanted me to move to Ohio with him, to marry him. I cared for him & I liked him a lot but I left him, for many reasons. We ended ugly but I miss him. I keep wanting to reach out to him but it’s not the best idea to. I just hate ending on ugly terms with anybody. I broke his heart and I feel horrible but he broke mine too.  Bottom line, a relationship either leads to a break up or a marriage so be prepared for a heartbreak or a Happy ever after.
I’m scared of you  I’m scared of all the fun we have  I’m scared of never having had this much fun with anyone  I’m scared of how these things have all ended before  I’m scared you only tell me what I want to hear  I’m scared I’m really just not that good  I’m scared of you changing your mind  I’m scared of losing myself  I’m scared of being used  I’m scared of getting hurt I’m scared of how you make me laugh I’m scared of how you make me cry  I’m scared of this going well  I’m scared that you love me  I’m scared that I love you  I’m scared of you leaving  But when I’m with you, and you’re holding me I’m not scared at all. It feels like the best place to be.
The sun is going down and our feet’s pressed in the sand You lean against my shoulder as I hold your gentle hand  But the look upon your face is darker than the night I ask you what is wrong you say everything’s alright But you feel nothing You feel nothing at all As we are sitting there on come out favorite song We know all the lyrics we could sing them all night long But the beating of your heart is as violent as a drum  Your body begins to ache but again you feel so numb  Oh you feel nothing At all You don’t want things to change as you say you are sorry  You say we could still be friends as you offer sympathy But everything must change and I don’t know what’s real  Oh everything turns grey oh I don’t know what what to feel So I feel nothing  At all Oh I feel nothing I feel nothing Oh I feel…
I came home from work knowing full well what was going to happen. I was getting dumped by my boyfriend of 2 and a half years. I could tell just by reading his text message to me. It was his tone in the message and lack of care. I knew it all too well.  December 16th, 2014 ended pretty badly for me. And December 17th was not much better. Things only seemed to get worse from there. First I lost my partner, my best friend. Then I lost my house. Then my dogs. And just like that a whole year swept by like a flash flood.  I think I’m better now. I think I got over it. Maybe things are getting better. I’m certain my life is better without him. But hearing his name still cuts me. And knowing that his new year brought the birth of his 1st child is the salt in my wound. When I think about his new life, new girlfriend, new baby, new family…I’m picking at my own scabs. I think I’m over the psychological self harm. It’s such a good feeling to block someone you once were in love with. Blocked on my phone. Blocked on all social media accounts. I’ve blocked them from my life. Built a wall up all around my virtual life. And then I’m standing in line at a Young Thug concert and he strolls right past me, new girlfriend in tow. The one he left me for. The one he cheated on me with. The one he now has a child with. He’s still wearing the shirt I bought him at Christmas. They don’t even notice that I’m there.  My life shattered to pieces and I was left to pick them all up all over again. I had nice friends who tried to help. But a breakup is something you have to pull yourself out of. You can’t use other people as bandages or you’ll never build up a tolerance. You won’t be able to handle the next one.  I hope this helps someone going through the same situation. I hope you know that you are going to get through this and come out alive on the other side.  You are worth more than you know. You are stronger than you think you are. You are resilient. You are worthy of love and honesty.  The next days, weeks, months, years, after your breakup will be difficult but one day it will be a little less bad and you will realize you didn’t even think of your ex at all. They didn’t even cross your mind. Kind of like an old scar that has long since healed and faded. A wound that only you know the whole story behind.
Make a decision that is so so SO bad in which society views it but it’s so right in your heart and doesn’t hurt anybody because OMG I’m so happy rn
Thinking about my want of the Afterglow makes me weep. Everytime I hear that song I just twiddle my thumps & sigh 😳…..one day though, one day. Clearly 2025-16 may not be the time for such things.
People always go after the wrong ones even when the right ones are in front of their eyes.
Memories make me miss the ones who used to mean so much to me. Reality makes me remember that I’m better off without them.
All I need is someone who isn’t going to give up on me no matter how hard i am to deal with. Because I know what its like to put up with me, i have to do it everyday.
I’m trying to get my mind off things so if anyone wants to talk then message me!
Man, I hate the whole chemical withdrawal thing. I’ll think I’m doing okay, that I can get a handle on things…and then I go 48 hours without being in the same room with her and I start to just crash hard. All my thoughts become way more negative and destructive. And then she comes home and I interact with her for twenty minutes and my mood improves 500%. I mean, I’m still sad we’re not a couple, but I feel stronger. Braver. Like I can Handle It. I hate being an addict. But I honestly think I’m better off this way than going cold turkey, even if it were possible
Nostalgia is a dirty liar. It will deceive you and make you believe things were better than they were. Don’t let it do that to you. There’s a reason you are where you are now.
Note on the text: I used Ronald Gregor Smith’s translation of the second edition of Martin Buber’s I and Thou published by Charles Schribner’s Sons in 1958. The biggest thing to appreciate in Martin Buber seminal philosophic text, I and Thou, is how he describe the I-It relationship as coming out of an impulse for an I-Thou relationship. “I perceive something. I am sensible of something. I think something. The life of a human being does not consist of this and this alone. This, and the like, together, establish the realm of It” (4). The I-It relationship is the relationship we have with objects of a physical and non-physical nature, this includes people. Well it is one kind of relationship that we have with those objects, there is another, more primal, relationship that we seek out. What could be more primal, more basic, than the one just described? The I-It relationship reflects the non-reciprocal relationship we have with those objects. The I-Thou relationship on the other hand reflects the reciprocal relationships we have with those objects, ones in which the object can relate back to us. Ones where the object actually offers you something in return above and beyond that which you sought to get from it. What you get receive from the objects that you engage with in an I-Thou type of relationship is, in essence, a fuller picture of yourself.  Experiencing an object as an object does not expand your understanding of yourself in any way. Seeing a tree as just something that is tall, leafy and green adds nothing to your experience of yourself because you’re cutting up the tree into individual pieces that all individually fit into your world-view. If however you see an individual being, as something that lives outside of the categories that you put it into, then you can learn things about yourself from the tree. This sounds like hippy-dippy bullshit, but it isn’t really. We actually instinctively want to interact with the world in an I-Thou type of way, and it is out of this primal instinct that the I-It relationship, the mode of thinking that we are used to using in our interactions with the world, comes out. The former is natural and the latter builds upon it. When a child reaches out to touch something he is not actually seeking to learn anything about the object itself, but the about the object’s relation to himself: it hurts me, its skin is rougher than mine, I like it, I don’t like it etc. These all reflect the child’s relationship with that object, and the object in turn teaches the child something about himself and who, or what he is: “it is not the case that the child first perceives [an] object and then,as it were, puts himself in relationship to it. But the effort to establish [a] relation comes first- the hand of a child [reaches] out so that [whatever] is over [and] against him may nestle [on] it” (27). The reason for this is that it is “through the Thou that a man becomes ‘I’” (28). It is only by seeking things out on their own terms, by seeing what they are “in themselves” that we learn how we are. The touches a candle, experiences it, and realizes something about himself: that he is not on fire, not that small etc. The child hears another baby crying and realizes that that is another baby, separate and distinct from himself. But all these revelations can only happen when we encounter something either for the first time or in a new way. Repeated exposure to those objects solidifies the way that we interact with them, and codifies that which those objects, and again this includes people, have taught us about ourselves. A flame cannot teach an adult any more about what it is to be human than it has already done- the adult knows that he burns. Repeated exposure to objects distills everything into various categories of facts. This has to happen as it is “the exalted melancholy of our fate that every Thou in our world must become an It” (16). As soon as the relationship between the subject and the object has been worked out the Thou becomes an It- simply another object among objects. Once he has recognized his relationship to that object, once it has become an I-It relationship, than that relationship, for the most part, becomes locked in the past; and “in so far as man rests satisfied with the things he experiences and uses, he lives in the past” (12). He expects that object, a flame for example, to interact with him in the way that it always has, and it is very hard, though not impossible, to move from an I-It relationship to an I-Thou relationship. Generally it means experiencing that object in a whole new light: like the difference between the flame of a candle and the flame of a volcano. But the object in an I-It relationship no longer has the ability to teach the person something new about himself. As I said before, the adult already knows that he is the type of being who will burn if he touches the flame.  The more common way that people experience the I-Thou relationship, even latter in life, is by going out to experience entirely new objects, and, again, this includes people. In doing so this causes people have to develop a deeper understanding of themselves by constantly forcing them to expand their own world-view and their own sense of reality. It is, ultimately, this deeper knowledge of self that every individual is truly seeking, and that is why the I-Thou relationship is of primary importance.
I always thought of you as my Summer Warm and welcoming With longer days But you’ve proven to be more of a Winter Cold and distant Bringing lonely nights  -iwrotethisformeforyouforus
So lets see i just finished that post that i was meaning to post a month ago. The whole reason i was writing on that particular day was because it was the day before their one month. They are now coming up on two months but having issues, but I’ll get to that. Why don’t i just start with where i left off in that last one? Where they had just started dating? They started dating that Saturday, a mere week after he broke up with me. I didn’t want to see them together, i didn’t want to talk to them, but i had to because if i didn’t they would know that something was wrong and i wasn’t dealing with that./ But i was really miserable, i was cutting and loathing myself. But i wanted them to be happy. I would complain to two of my friends about how i couldn’t handle it anymore, after Zoe’s party i was just going to drop her, which i did mean. Well she apparently has two friends in that same class that i would complain, so they went to go tell her and she confronted me, i lied to her point blank. Said i would never say anything like that. I wasn’t getting uninvited to her party, so i lied, without issue. While we are at her party, in the van to creepy hollow she is all over him, even looking like she is sitting in his lap, i don’t know for sure i was playing on my phone in the very back trying to ignore everyone, for that exact reason. And then she is sitting by me at her house and i can see it bothering him so i tell her to move. Then we slept side by side in a super awkward position, well more so awkward for her if he were to find out.  Then everything kind of calmed down, i didn’t drop her, and i was trying to be better, trying to get over him, still cutting. Then came November and they started having issues. But not major ones or anything, unfortunately. Then he was her date to Homecoming, i was so fucking miserable that night. I got in a fight with her that night too. The next day i go over to Dylan’s house which also pisses her off. But i didn’t really care we got in another fight that night and i was again ready to drop her.  Then Dylan got really sick, he had bronchitis. Zoe is the biggest fucking germaphobe, so i was checking in on him, and seeing how he was feeling. Well i would text him every few hours, ask how he was doing, and i continued this over the weekend. Well Saturday he wasn’t texting me back. And i figured he was asleep, only to find out that he took Zoe to the movies. Yes, I fucking realize, “She’s his girlfriend he can take her out whenever he wants.” Shut the fuck up, that’s not what pissed me off. You’re going to be so sick, then just go out on a date? Completely ignore the only person who is giving a shit about your well being? Okay fine, if you’re feeling well enough to go out on a date with your fucking girlfriend, you obviously don’t need me checking up on you. The next day he apologized saying that he had been driving at the time, i didn’t really care.  Well Zoe was acting weird all weekend, like asking me to make her smile and laugh, but wouldn’t tell me what the fuck was wrong. I finally got it out of her Monday because we were hanging out. She had apparently been to hands on when they were at the movie, and he ended up fingering her. It bothered her, she didn’t want him to go inside her. And she wouldn’t talk to him about it. Well when she finally talked to him about it, and told him that she hadn’t been ready for that, he told her that it had bothered him too, and made him have flashbacks to a time he doesn’t want to remember, because she kept putting his hand closer to her, i don’t fucking know. I didn’t want to know the details. But so they were having issues with that. That weekend, the band had their Masquerade dance, and since over the summer Zoe had planned on taking me. Well with the driving us everywhere, we went to the festival of lights, had to go pick up an ROTC cadet, go up to the school, go to the parade, wait to figure up what was going on with the cadet, then change into our costumes, then buy make-up, and finally go to the Masquerade. In all of this time she wasn’t texting him, but she would post on snapchat. So they had issues over that. And that was the beginning of the Thanksgiving holidays. Well me and Zoe hung out that Monday because we still had college, and she was getting really self-conscience. She was saying how she thinks that me and Dylan would be a better fit than her and him, that she should just break up with him, and i try to convince her otherwise and blah, blah, blah.  Fast forward to Thanksgiving, I’m in Pasadena, and Zoe and I are talking mostly using snapchat. Well she posts on her story, a picture of her and Dylan saying Happy Holidays. Yes again they are dating they can do shit like that but it still bothered me. And then she was talking about drinking, even though any time i talk about drinking she would get pissed off and not talk to me anymore. But when she does it, it’s perfectly okay. I was just really fucking done.  Fast forward to December, and she tells me that she talked to him about that same thing. That he should just date me an he would be happier. Well according to her he said, that he couldn’t date me again, I’m a great friend, but he just couldn’t see himself dating me. But i wouldn’t know this until December.  Back to November, the Saturday after Thanksgiving, my family and I took Dylan with us to the Renaissance Festival, I had asked him back in July, and he is my best friend so I still wanted him to go. It was fine, we weren’t flirting or anything. But on the ride home I was bored and didn’t want us to just be on our phones the whole time, so I started a poke war between the two of us, alternating between actual poking and tickling. This is entirely fucking innocent, i was not in any way, shape, or form trying to flirt with him. He poked my cheek so i poked his back, and that started a whole thing of poking each others faces, which he did first, and if anything that was kind of flirting but he started it. Especially because when he would poke my nose i would scrunch it up, which he seemed to think was cute or some shit because he kept doing it.  Then he got like really sad, and i didn’t understand why, so i was trying to cheer him up, and he typed out on his phone that he has been having random bouts of depression. I couldn’t really fix it, especially when i knew it was because of Zoe. I didn’t do anything differently, but he did. He would poke my face, then caress my cheek, I would poke his face, and he would try to nuzzle my hand, is the best thing i can think of. Then when i would just have my hand sitting between us, and we would be poking each other’s hand back and forth, he would almost try to hold my hand. I was trying to pull away some, but truthfully I didn’t want to. And that went on for the rest of the night.  The next day he texted me when he woke up and we texted all day, and so that started our whole issue which I’m going to go over in another post because this one is long af. So december is in a new post of course. I can’t ever fucking finish these the same day i start them so who knows when you will actually get that one.
Make a decision that is so so SO bad in which society views it but it’s so right in your heart and doesn’t hurt anybody because OMG I’m so happy rn

Yes, I fucking realize, “She’s his girlfriend he can take her out whenever he wants.” Shut the fuck up, that’s not what pissed me off. You’re going to be so sick, then just go out on a date? Completely ignore the only person who is giving a shit about your well being? Okay fine, if you’re feeling well enough to go out on a date with your fucking girlfriend, you obviously don’t need me checking up on you. The next day he apologized saying that he had been driving at the time, i didn’t really care.  Well Zoe was acting weird all weekend, like asking me to make her smile and laugh, but wouldn’t tell me what the fuck was wrong. I finally got it out of her Monday because we were hanging out. She had apparently been to hands on when they were at the movie, and he ended up fingering her. It bothered her, she didn’t want him to go inside her. And she wouldn’t talk to him about it. Well when she finally talked to him about it, and told him that she hadn’t been ready for that, he told her that it had bothered him too, and made him have flashbacks to a time he doesn’t want to remember, because she kept putting his hand closer to her, i don’t fucking know. I didn’t want to know the details. But so they were having issues with that. That weekend, the band had their Masquerade dance, and since over the summer Zoe had planned on taking me. Well with the driving us everywhere, we went to the festival of lights, had to go pick up an ROTC cadet, go up to the school, go to the parade, wait to figure up what was going on with the cadet, then change into our costumes, then buy make-up, and finally go to the Masquerade. In all of this time she wasn’t texting him, but she would post on snapchat. So they had issues over that. And that was the beginning of the Thanksgiving holidays. Well me and Zoe hung out that Monday because we still had college, and she was getting really self-conscience. She was saying how she thinks that me and Dylan would be a better fit than her and him, that she should just break up with him, and i try to convince her otherwise and blah, blah, blah.  Fast forward to Thanksgiving, I’m in Pasadena, and Zoe and I are talking mostly using snapchat. Well she posts on her story, a picture of her and Dylan saying Happy Holidays. Yes again they are dating they can do shit like that but it still bothered me. And then she was talking about drinking, even though any time i talk about drinking she would get pissed off and not talk to me anymore. But when she does it, it’s perfectly okay. I was just really fucking done.  Fast forward to December, and she tells me that she talked to him about that same thing. That he should just date me an he would be happier. Well according to her he said, that he couldn’t date me again, I’m a great friend, but he just couldn’t see himself dating me. But i wouldn’t know this until December.  Back to November, the Saturday after Thanksgiving, my family and I took Dylan with us to the Renaissance Festival, I had asked him back in July, and he is my best friend so I still wanted him to go. It was fine, we weren’t flirting or anything. But on the ride home I was bored and didn’t want us to just be on our phones the whole time, so I started a poke war between the two of us, alternating between actual poking and tickling. This is entirely fucking innocent, i was not in any way, shape, or form trying to flirt with him. He poked my cheek so i poked his back, and that started a whole thing of poking each others faces, which he did first, and if anything that was kind of flirting but he started it. Especially because when he would poke my nose i would scrunch it up, which he seemed to think was cute or some shit because he kept doing it.  Then he got like really sad, and i didn’t understand why, so i was trying to cheer him up, and he typed out on his phone that he has been having random bouts of depression. I couldn’t really fix it, especially when i knew it was because of Zoe. I didn’t do anything differently, but he did. He would poke my face, then caress my cheek, I would poke his face, and he would try to nuzzle my hand, is the best thing i can think of. Then when i would just have my hand sitting between us, and we would be poking each other’s hand back and forth, he would almost try to hold my hand. I was trying to pull away some, but truthfully I didn’t want to. And that went on for the rest of the night.  The next day he texted me when he woke up and we texted all day, and so that started our whole issue which I’m going to go over in another post because this one is long af. So december is in a new post of course. I can’t ever fucking finish these the same day i start them so who knows when you will actually get that one.

At this point in the relationship, I gotta wonder if it’s really worth all the trouble. I can’t stand this petty behaviour and attitude.
I wish I could tell someone who needs it that you can’t be friends with the person you broke up with due to them treating you badly. If they pretended you were shit while together, there is no possible way they will respect you after you part.  I want to save a life goddammit.
I want my next boyfriend to be a good dancer and like to go out and dance but I don’t want him to be a better dancer than me…which isn’t saying much because I’m not that great of a dancer lol.
Why do we want things back so bad that only cause us pain when we have it?
Ran into my ex and he was wearing this jacket that brought back sooooo many memories we had and now I can’t get him out of my head . Great.😢😭
My mom asked if I’ve still kept connected with the people I’ve befriended from first semester of college. I told her who I’ve kept in contact with. I mentioned about you and how you and I don’t talk anymore and how I’m okay with that and that its “whatever.” That was the first time that I said that out loud in a long time and it felt good. You didn’t deserve me and you never did in the first place.  A few words of advice: 1. don’t pursue a relationship with a person who does things you don’t agree with. 2. don’t pursue a relationship with a person who puts down the music you listen to. 3. don’t pursue a relationship with a person who makes fun of a persons style. 4. don’t pursue a relationship with a person who is lazy in their academic career.  Literally the list goes on. You’ve taught me a lot and I thank you for that. But the whole situation overall was shitty and I’m mad I wasted my time on you.
does anyone following me give good dating/relationship advice? cause i’m lonely as hell and feel like shit and no dating site or app anyone ever responds. i just wish someone would love me.
I got a boyfriend. He’s my very first boyfriend. I’m 21 years old. Right now I’m on vacation from school, which I finished this semester with an excellent overall grade. I take care of my chores at home and am a generally respectful and responsible daughter, always asking my parents for permission to go out, using my own money to pay for this outings, respecting curfews, etcetera. When I’m home alone, I often read or watch TV or surf the web because there’s not much else to do when I’m home alone. My parents say this is not productive and they hate it when I do this. When I’m with my boyfriend, we go to the movies or to the theatre or to museums. He helped me get a freelance job and he’ll help me get a computer and set it up for school and work and whatnot. Lately I have been going out with my boyfriend almost every day. My brother says that I’m “burning up” my permissions to go out with my boyfriend, when we’ve never arrived too late (I’m always home by 10 at the most) or in an inconvenient state (drunk or high or anything). Am I abusing the “privilege” of being with the person that I love?
What’s it like to have people admire you and have a crush on you?
“There’s an argument to be made that beneath every cynic, there’s a frustrated romantic.” – Peter Bishop, Fringe   I think I gotta stop having crushes on people. It really has not worked out well for me. Or maybe stop having unattainable crushes to be more specific. I’m starting to think this whole liking somebody racket is just not for me. Of the last few girls I was into one was a total pipe dream and the other two turned out to be gay, not to mention the first girl I was ever in love with was a complete unrequited love scenario. I mean just once I’d like to be into someone who I even remotely had a chance with. And that’s not even the low self esteem talking, I mean I’m no George Clooney (who is? am I right ladies ;) ) but I’m a decent guy. I’m smart, I’ve been told I have a boyish charm about me, I’ve been known to successfully crack a few jokes in my time, and I have a pretty decent top ten list of my favorite TV and Movies, you know all the stuff girls go crazy for.   “A person doesn’t know true hurt and suffering until they’ve felt the pain of falling in love with someone whose affections lie elsewhere.” ― Rose Gordon, Her Imperfect Groom   Seriously, I’m starting to wonder if I’m only gonna be into girls that I can’t get. My most recent crush was like a cruel joke. She was smart, cute, funny, a bit geeky. She was perfect. Then boom, found out she’s gay and I never had a chance. After this I’m starting to think the universe is having a good laugh at the expense of my love life. I’m not even sure it can be called a love life which tells you all you need to know right there.   “Huge events take place on this earth every day. Earthquakes, hurricanes, even glaciers move. So why couldn’t he just look at me?” – My So-Called Life   Look, I’m not asking for the whole package here, I’m not even talking about all the stuff that comes after the crush like asking out or making any kind of move. I don’t know whether it’s a blessing or a curse that it doesn’t even get to that point. I don’t even need a guarantee the girl will like me. I just want to be in a situation where I’m into a girl and there’s a chance that she could like me back in the same way. Christ I sound like I’m in grade school. This is what happens when you’re awkward, anxiety filled and don’t date all throughout high school, you end up writing open letters on the internet to the Universe, Cupid, Aphrodite, God, whomever cosmically has a hand in these things about your romantic frustrations. Actually now that I think about it this could be an interesting start to a romantic comedy. That’s just what I need, to be the star of my own personal Rom Com. But if I was it’d totally be directed and written by Richard Curtis. Have you seen Notting Hill and Love Actually? ‘Nuff Said. Went a bit off topic there.   “There’s someone out there for everyone - even if you need a pickaxe, a compass, and night goggles to find them.” – L.A. Story   I’m sure everyone feels this way at a certain point. You wanna know there are people out there who can love you, who could care about you. You wanna know that dating, being happy, being in a relationship, finding someone is not just something you’re destined to watch from the sidelines. That there are people out there you’ll mesh with and who’ll want you just as much as you want them. I think when you get down to it that’s true for everyone. So at least I know I’m not alone there.   “There’s nothing quite so humbling as thinking you’re completely over someone, then realizing you’re not even close.” – Brian Strause, Maybe a Miracle   Alright, to bring this to a close (and to be perfectly honest I have no idea exactly what this is) I just wanna say all I’m asking for here is a chance, a fair shot at the opportunity to win someone’s heart. I wanna know when I start liking someone, when I throw my hat into the proverbial ring for their affection that I actually have a fighting chance to win. I know it’s probably a fool’s errand to want to have that much control over who you fall for. I’m also sure i’m not the only one who’s wanted to limit their crushes to safe bets in order to avoid heartbreak, but as someone frustratingly smarter than me once said the heart wants what it wants. I just wish mine took into account the heartbreak garnered by continually falling for someone who’s out of reach.   “All our young lives we search for someone to love. Someone who makes us complete. We choose partners and change partners. We dance to a song of heartbreak and hope. All the while wondering if somewhere, somehow, there’s someone perfect, who might be searching for us.” – The Wonder Years
im not poly, i dont want to share, i dont want you to fall in love with someone else, i dont want you to want anyone else because i only want you damnit
It’s amusing how much you can learn in a short amount of time about a person after you stop being blind about who they really are. I tended to do that with exes. I did it for way too long with one guy in high school. I thought I could change him. Psht. I cried way too much over that boy. But then I rid him from my life, and finally started to see what he really was. A modern day fuckboi and player behind the ruse of a good Christian boy. He still hides behind that too. And then made the foolish mistake of dating his best friend, as if I thought he would be any better. He was, for the most part. He treated me better, but he also lied. He’s the only guy who ever dumped me. I cried for a long time. Tried to hold onto the relationship. (He told me he was blackmailed into breaking up with me, but still wanted to date me. Another lie…) His whole existence was a lie. I still have a list of all the beautiful things he said to me, and I still cry when I read them. I didn’t really seriously date in high school after that. No one is my town was worth dating. I moved to college and tried my first long distance relationship. I hated it. It was nothing he did. It was all my fault for starting to have a useless crush on one dude, therefore thinking my feelings for the long distance weren’t true enough. I discovered later that I was wrong. I broke up with my long distance, then started dating this new crush of mine. It wasn’t worth it. He was always started the fights with me. I got so tired of fighting with him after he yelled at me for no reason. I broke up with him two days later after he told me why he had gotten angry at me. He was never a bad guy, he just always started arguments with me that made me mad. This is when I realized my previous mistake of breaking up with my long distance. I tried to stay away, but couldn’t. Ended up crying too much over a boy again. Had a fling with a guy I shouldn’t have even considered talking to. Tinder is a cesspool. Again, I latched on. He was the prettiest guy I had ever been with. Oldest too. Expected him to be…more mature. HA! Was I wrong. He stopped talking to me one day, then 4 months later he was engaged…after previously telling me he wasn’t one of those military guys that gets married after 3 months. I had fallen for another liar. I had gotten attached after over 6 months of texting and only 3 weeks of hanging out. I cried some more until I latched onto Ed Sheeran’s “Don’t Fuck With My Love.” I was still friends with my one and only long distance. We stayed…kind of friends for a while. I still had a thing for him but thought he would never like me again after I broke things off with him from many months ago… but still we talked over snapchat and text… Eventually, after way too long, a friend pointed out to me all the…shitty things he’d done to me. I won’t say I was perfect and never did him wrong, but I was blind, like almost every other ex, to all the shit he was putting me through. He expected double standards, would flirt with me after I was beating myself up and finally coming to terms with he didn’t like me anymore, I wouldn’t expect anything of him because I didn’t want to become the “crazy ex,” but he expected everything from me, and whole other shit storm I won’t go into…I ended up dating the guy who told me to drop him…we’re still dating. He’s the best guy I’ve ever had. But as I look back on all my exes, I was blind to who they were, because I was looking for someone, anyone to “love” me. Because I considered myself unlovable, unattractive, and unwanted. Any attention was immediately considered a lie until they showed attraction, and then I would latch on and hold on for dear life. I grow attached too easily because of the above mentioned reasons. And that makes me blind to the leeches. I’m not saying they’re bad people (well some of them), but they were bad for me.
Piecing everything together has proven to be difficult, but we have learned from each other and our collective efforts have been fruitful.-M.G.
i hate those posts that say shit like “if you aren’t 100% happy in your relationship you need to leave because those people are toxic” like shut the fuck up. I’m not in my relationship right now to be happy all the time. consider that mental illness is a thing and sometimes using our struggles we both have to help each other cope is actually really great and helpful? and there’s nothing happy about it at all? so please cut the crap with the “always be happy with your partner” and shit because I’m doing this for him. not me.
I know I should… But it’s so hard to bring up  It’s not something I can just say over dinner  I almost called him when I was drunk  Then I could have told him But I knew I’d tell him if I called so I didn’t  But maybe then he would understand why I get freaked out sometimes  For what seems like no reason  And sometimes really for no reason  But then he’d look at my differently  People always do  So I’ll stay quiet Some secrets aren’t meant to be shared  Even with those were closest too
That day all i kept thinking was how to put my feelings into words, my mind raced like your car,  with words to put in flowing sentences. I wanted to record how every moment felt, how grass blades made me smile just because I was next to you. Living in a symphony, poised with smooth turns, And creating lines as if you were a composer, and i wanted it all to pour out on paper. Because I was happy to be alive.  By your side, with reckless ambitions.
I’m falling in love with my best friend and I’m begging for it to be the right time. I simply could not watch another girl tear apart the purest heart I know…  My only hope is that I don’t destroy the sweet boy who has stood beside me for all these years; it would be an unkindness to this world to ever dampen that boy’s smile…
My freshman year of college I had this huge crush on a friend of a friend. My interactions with him were very limited. But when I did get to see him here and there- I was completely obsessed. An important thing to keep in mind is I had never spoken to him one on one. I knew nothing about him, but I was fully convinced he was the one for me. He had everything that I thought I wanted, and he physically looked like my dream guy as well. He had thick framed glasses, was over 6 foot, wore beanies, smoked, had a beard, and played the guitar. If you know me, you know I don’t have to say anymore. He’s perfect for me. Well…guess what? He wasn’t. A year later I eventually told my friend I had a crush on him. She told him, which I didn’t really care about, and then he started to pursue me. We ended up having sex, and the whole “relationship” was happening so fast that I couldn’t believe it! Of course I went along with all of it no matter what, because I was excited someone like him even found me attractive. But then I actually got to know him. I got to see how he acted around others, his likes and dislikes, and learned some personal information about him. And after some reflecting, I came to realize how much he wasn’t for me. I couldn’t believe this, because I genuinely thought he was. You could think a guy is your dream guy or everything you could ever want just by looking at him. But then you get to know him, and you realize that’s not always the case. I mean I wanted to date this boy regardless, but our personalities weren’t similar. I think it would’ve been a hot ass mess if we ever did.  And that’s why you should never date someone who you think is perfect for you. You start out with such high expectations,that your mind creates, and he may never meet them.
This story and moment is very close to my heart. It is the story of the first time a boy told me he loved me.  I often see things online like: if you could only pick 1 memory to keep forever, what would it be? I notice this question often stumps people. However, I know what mine would be. A summer morning, at 7:02 am in the year 2013. On senior week, my graduating class had about 12 houses all in Ocean City, Maryland. It was huge, and everyone was down at the same time. It was one of the craziest and most fun weeks of my life. Every night we would all have a good time, and then some people would go to sleep and others would stay awake. Regardless, one thing was guaranteed: that we would alllll meet at the beach and watch the sunrise.  Pat was over the house I was staying in, and at this point in time we had been on and off for 3 years. Also, at this time we remained in very little contact, and were both trying to move on. My best friend, Cassie, had said how she wanted to watch the sunrise the next morning. We said okay, we want to come too. Pat and I stayed up the whole night talking. It was about 5 am, and we were about to head down to the beach. I went to go find Cassie and she was knocked out cold in her room. Even if I had woken her, I knew she wasn’t moving. So we decided to leave her, and just go. (Don’t worry she made it to other sunrises). We get to the beach. And it’s completely empty. Not a person in sight. It was weird, because I knew everyone had consecutively came here mornings before. And now all the sudden, there wasn’t a single person around. However, it just made what was to come even more special. Pat got on one knee on the sand.  And he just told me how he felt. He told me how he was in love with me, and always had been since we were 15. He told me how much I meant to him. He ranted for a full two hours, on an empty beach, with the sun rising for the day behind us. We checked the time when we came down from the high of it all, and it was 7:02 in the morning. It was the happiest moment of my life so far. It’s often hard to tell the story to people, because a) they weren’t there and b) because of that, they can’t really grasp how incredible it was. I just think it’s hard for people to understand how monumental it was for Pat and I and also myself, just on my own. No boyfriend/boy of interest had ever told me they loved me until this point. It was indescribable. Most people ask me what I said to him after like, did I say I love you back? And I did, because I had been in love with him since the day I met him. I remember holding his hand, looking down at him on one knee, and just doing this weird laugh/cry thing. I wanted to cry, but I was laughing(not at him) because I was so speechless. I didn’t say anything for the whole two hours, it was all him. This moment changed my life. It changed Pat & I’s relationship forever. After it was finally said, we never stopped. We were on top of the world. It was the happiest I had ever been in my life. And then shortly after, we began dating- and we dated for a long time. He had told me later on that he had contemplated telling me he loved me when he asked me to our Senior prom. But decided against it. I’m glad he waited :) The moment was perfect. Today, in 2015, Pat and I remain in zero contact. We are completely out of each others lives, and both in different relationships. But to me, that doesn’t matter- because I will always have this memory. I will remember it for the rest of my life like I told myself I would the day it happened.
I decided to do a tag today, to spice it up if you will. I just found it on tumblr, nothing special  1. Are looks important in a relationship? I would say so yes, anyone who says no is lying. 2.

so far this break up has been way easier than i thought it would be. i have amazing support from my friends and my housemates who i haven’t even known that long. like i have been so lucky to have this house and these housemates they are all freaking great people and i love them all already. i don’t miss alex. i haven’t cried since i got home yesterday after breaking up with him. i feel so positive about it all and a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders. i’m still heartbroken but at the same time my mood has been so much better. another thing, the most amazing person i have ever met kissed me last night. a lot. and we cuddled. a lot. because finally we can. i have so many positive things to say about him but that would make this post 8000 words long. he is truly special. i am so lucky. he is one of my housemates ~ possibly complicated i know. last night i fell asleep in his arms and spent the night in his bed and it was the nicest feeling waking up next to him. (he has told me he loves me four times) (i love him too but not in the i’m in love with you way…yet) (i just love the person he is so much)
I don’t even remember what it’s like to feel loved
Young children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) may experience more problems socializing with their peers, which can then contribute to worsening symptoms, a new study from Norway suggests. But the cycle between symptoms and social problems seems to…… Newsmax Health – Health NewsADHD Impedes Social Relationships Early in Life ADHD Impedes Social Relationships Early in Life was originally published on Health And Fitness Today
I know relationships (the good ones at least) are built on friendship at first. However, every time I try to think about dating one of my friends, I panic because I don’t want to ruin a good thing if we break up? But at the same time I also wonder how some of my friends would react if I had a crush on them. I wouldn’t want them to feel uncomfortable or awkward…o///o
Sleeping in your s/o’s clothes because they can’t be there with you
So I just finished all my exams and I’ve been reflecting on some things that have happened this past year and honestly I feel so blessed. Starting in January and fast tracking so that I finish with school by April (which means I gave up my job and my summer so that I could finish within a year) and pushing myself to do well and achieve high marks in multiple classes, so that when I do graduate I can feel confident when I go get my license. It makes me really happy to see that all the work I’ve been putting into this program is paying off. Ive become really positive in my life and it’s great because last year I was dealing with depression and now I’m able to be positive without the use of meds. I have a boyfriend that loves me and I care so much about him. He’s been my motivation to be better and to do better. And just knowing that at the end of the day, it’s just me and him. No one else matters. We’ve both changed as individuals and grown together as a couple in a good way of course :). I’ve also removed myself from toxic relationship, I’m avoiding to use social media as an outlet to my problems and I’ve been trying to limit how much I actually post on snapchat/ Twitter. I just don’t need to be publishing my every moment. Anyways I’m happy and I’m at peace.
I just want him to be okay again. I want him to be happy again and full of life. I want to see his eyes light up again. I want him to love me so much because he has feelings again, he has a heart again, a heart that wants to live, a heart that’s full, a heart that’s happy. Satisfied. Fulfilled.  I may not pray much, and I may not know if when I do pray God is listening. But when I do pray, it’s always for you. I sit in my car and cry for 30 mins and pray. Pray for peace for you, pray for love to fill your life, pray for happiness to find you.  I won’t ever give up on you.
You get better at finding the red flags with every relationship but maybe you dont get better at taking them seriously. I remember one time you turned to me and said with great conviction “I am not good enough for you.” I laughed. I asked why. I never really did get a response but you said it more than once. All I did was encourage you. I should have believed you. I thought you were just being flirtatious with a dry tone. Little did I realize it was a true confession. You would never be good enough for me because you could never believe yourself to be deserving of a whole and complete love with a total package woman.  Would we have been able to make it if I wasnt talented or pretty? if I couldnt cook, if we didnt work in such symbiosis? Maybe if we never talked about threatening things like marriage and children. Maybe if your family didnt like me. What if I treated you like shit. Maybe we could have made it if I minimized myself in some way. Maybe if i was clingy or jealous. What if i didnt show you all the adventures we went on. what if I remained emotionally unavailable like I was in the beginning when I was still unimpressed by you? I should have remained emotionally unavailable. You redefined everything I thought love was. None of it would have been worth anything if i didnt give it my all and give the best of myself. I thought we were growing together.
The physical can be rocking but if that mental sloppy, I can’t dig you. Damn shame because it’s so many good looking men but they bland as hell and the convo need flava. I gotta have that mental connection or else Imma lose interest quick. We gotta talk about more than haters, clothes, who did who dirty, etc…..damn can I feel something? 😐
I sometimes wish I was cold hearted I wouldn’t care about people so much even after they try to make me look stupid
i had 2 chances with my first love… TWO! Today, we are not together… its been 5 months post breakup and im still sitting here like a sad potato. why? because I love him. i still love him. its sad and its sick, but unfortunately, it is true. i dont want it to be, but it is. i miss him. i dont want to feel this anymore. i dont want to feel anything, i dont even want to love. i just want to sleep into the next century. i know that sounds stupid. i know “the world has 7 billion people” blah blah… i know… but right now… and for the past 5 months it feels like i’ve been walking through an emotional purgatory. i feel everything and nothing all at once.
These girls will love you one day and then run off with what you taught them the next. No I want all my slang , style , drugs , kindness , and compliments that I gave you back ! your officially a square again
I want someone who makes me feel that First Flush every time I look at them.
You enter my thoughts  more often than I want you to And trying to get you out never works.. Crazy that as much as I think about you I’m not sure what it is that I think of you and that’s what scares me… Because the strongest connections don’t require a lot of words And the strongest feelings can never really be explained
People confuse being one-note with being “authentic,” but you can be different things to different people without compromising yourself. Showing a different side of your personality, style, love language, interests, humor, whatever, etc, doesn’t make you fake. You stay real by doing what feels right in that moment, in that space, with that person, with yourself. Do you and you’ll always stay 1hunnid.
happy and excited   the world is a pile of shit   why is the world a pile of shit   3. the world is such shit what can we do to change it  2. we’re fucked we can’t we want to but we don’t know how 1. fuck where did all the sunlight go it cold in here
Y'know, a lot of the “problems” or “things” in my previous relationship had nothing to do with me. I realize this now that I’m in a healthy relationship. Honestly, I’m not calling myself perfect, but he was kind of emotionally abusive and just had a way of bringing out literally the worst in me. I am nothing but my true self now - kind, caring, funny, etc. All positive things. I’m not overly-dramatic, overly-sensitive, or constantly on the offense or defense like I was with my ex. I also get the attention and affection that I deserve. I am not ignored or treated like a second option all the time. I am treated like I’m important and like I matter. I am loved simply because I’m me. My ex really messed me up, but I’m choosing to take that and grow from it instead of let it break me. I realize his true nature now and he seriously needs some psychological help. I truly believe that everything that transpired before meeting my current boyfriend happened so I could meet him at the time that I did. He is my soulmate - 100%. He is helping to heal me by reminding me of who I really am. It’s like we’ve known each other many lifetimes before. He is everything I have ever wanted or needed or dreamed of. We never fight, and when we have a disagreement, we talk it out like adults and move on rather quickly. We are truly silly kids at heart, but in a healthy adult relationship. We respect our independence and aren’t completely dependent on each other. We share a ton of interests and similarities, but we also have some healthy differences here and there and we are our own people. We have our own little languages and inside jokes that we goof around with. It’s like we’ve known each other for years already despite only actually knowing each other for half a year. We want the same things and both want kids. He’s a few years younger than my ex was, yet he’s more of a man and has more life experience than my ex ever did, and he’s a better match for me a million times over. He has a future for himself and is almost done with his undergraduate degree. He takes care of himself. He works and has a job, and a guaranteed job after he gets his undergraduate degree. He lives on his own and knows how to live by himself. I feel very secure emotionally and in life with him. Honestly, my life has been seriously upgraded and has gotten so much better. I feel so grateful and blessed to have my best friend and soulmate by my side. He is amazing and I truly love him with all my heart & soul. ❤
I have this friend who I’ve known for about 7 yrs and I’ve always liked him. Last year I wrote about how I finally asked him out and before then I gave him a birthday gift and he accepted it, then Christmas came and I gave him one then too and finally asked him out then winter break came and during this time we’re talking like everything is normal then I’m like “when are we going on that date????” And he said that he’s been talking to another girl the whole time. I am still heartbroken over that but I acted as if everything was fine. Now he’s flirting with me and I’m just trying my best to keep it together because I’ve grown to love him even more but, I just don’t know what to do. Anytime /I/try to get close he pulls away all over again, but then he does things that are no big deal for him but mean the world to me. I can’t tell if he wants to be with me or not. I hurt so bad.

Not to sound whiny or anything but I just feel like ranting because I want to feel better. This pill I was given aint doing anything to my emotions but making it worse lol.  Not that there’s something wrong with my current partner but when you’re in a LDR and he doesn’t talk to you for a week you know something is wrong. Not saying he’s cheating, cause he’s incapable of that. But if he has the time to change his skype status and profile picture but doesn’t bother to read kik messages, then something is up. And I have nobody to answer to but myself about it lol. Cause I brought this on myself. Ffs. I can’t really be in a relationship I assume.
December 17th, 2015 “‘Dear God, the only thing I ask of you is to hold her when I’m not around, when I’m much too far away.’ - Avenged Sevenfold” What a cute boy I have! ^_^
I’m talking about that game of hearts lyfe…   Why is it that, when a guy makes an overt display of affection    i.e. Randomly stating that they are coming over now, even if it is late, because they want to just be with you. …it can be seen as romantic in most cases (especially if that is what you want.)?? But…if a lady does it, she can be seen as crazy or clingy or that type?   Let’s say this is towards to the beginning when you are dating but you are feeling each other hard. I need to ask my LGBT crew if this applies since the hetero crowd does tend to want to place these hetero normative stereotypes on them. What’s up with that?
Ugh my boyfriends brother “R” we’ll call him is so fucking annoying. He’s super self-centered/absorbed, loud, obnoxious, a “rager” with games and not even in the understandable way, the “it didn’t go my way so ima yell” way, and he doesn’t take a hint when Mitch and I are going on a date that he’s not always invited along. Nor are we then paying for his meal because he invited himself along and doesn’t have money or understand that we can pay for eachother but not him… ugh
Many people believe that love is only a feeling. If you don’t “feel love” for someone that you once did, then the relationship is over. Feelings are fleeting and fickle. Love is meant to be unconditional. We have the option to make intentional choices, which means being intentional in our relationships. Choosing to love rather than waiting to feel it. Today, make a choice to do something or say something positive to someone that you don’t feel great about. Add something positive each day - give a hug or a compliment, run an errand or sit and listen. See if your feelings catch back up to your actions.
i hate when people are like “this person is a bad kisser” like, honestly i think the uniqueness of each person ive ever kissed is kinda beautiful. no ones kiss is the same and i’ve kissed guys who have used no tongue and have been great and guys who explore every corner of your mouth and have been great. maybe thats just me.
I just put together the cutest gift basket together for my boyfriend for Christmas, I can’t wait to give it to him. Also, I can’t wait to celebrate our first Christmas together/the first Christmas in the apartment :)
Personally I don’t think ALL white people are racist when they say that they arent attracted to black people. Some have a preference of not being attracted to black features and thats fine. Labelling them as racist or trying to convince them otherwise won’t benefit us in any way lol. Leave them to their mindset, I’d rather focus my energy on my black women that appreciate me for who I am rather than attempt to be an exception in the eyes of another.

Why do you ask what's under our shirt when flirting? You know what's under there, this isn't a guessing game. You're not at your house trying to guess "who's that Pokemon?" It's boobs. Step up you're game bro.
I know it’s sold to us as a virtue but I wish that everyone was more similar and less different. I crave unity. It seems like no one agrees on anything anymore. Or they pretend to agree just to not cause friction.
I’m fortunate to have had love and lost 6 years ago. Break ups are tough. They’re more tough when it’s your first love. You feel like the world stopped spinning. You ask yourself if something is wrong with you, what you could’ve done better and if it was true love, then you’d be together forever. I guess that’s what the fairy tales tell us when we were kids. You grieve. You believe life isn’t fair. You ask how you can ever go on with life. It’s a traumatic experience. But time passes, you grieve less and less, you move on. More importantly, you begin to put things in perspective. Yes, this relationship didn’t work out, but it was the first serious one, there are billions of others on this planet I’ve yet to meet. The world is still spinning. There is more to see and experience in life. I’m glad my first love didn’t work out because it helped me with the reality of the world. Not everything works out. And that’s okay.
im going out with my gf tonight and i feel so fucking sick. my stomach is screaming at me.
Are You Caring or Caretaking? Caring = giving to another from love, for the joy of it – as a free gift Caretaking = giving to get love, giving with an agenda attached, giving yourself up Even though the actions of caring and the actions of caretaking might look exactly the same, the intention is totally different, so… http://mental-health-matters.com/are-you-caring-or-caretaking/
I still remember the way your hair fell across your face as you were sleeping.  So tranquil, you lye there, silent but the sound of your breathe..  You were beautiful.  It seems as though it’s been eons since I’ve seen your eyes.  Although, it is my own fault, and my fault alone..  That I can no longer claim your heart as my home..    I made myself believe you didn’t love me. But you fought for me…..  I turned my back on my greatest light.    I resented you for loving me.  For making me feel… something..  other than the cold murkiness inside of me..  I wanted to be perfect for you.  Constantly changing.. becoming prettier.. purer..  And then I broke, through the fear of not being enough, I surrendered.  I wanted you to leave me, because I wasn’t strong enough to leave you.  I wanted you to resent me enough to let me go.  I wanted you to have some one who could be your definition of perfect..  but I knew it wasn’t me. For I.. am so terribly flawed..    It’s too late for justifications and excuses now.  My apologies will never mean anything to you..  Just know if I could turn back time..  I would have taken your offers long before Autumn..    I will drown in repentance.   I still remember the colour of your eyes..  -E.M. 2014
If you like me, tell me. If you think I’m pretty, tell me. If you want to text me, do it. If you just want to be friends, be upfront. If you want to date me, be honest with me. Don’t leave me guessing. All we ever do is play games with each other to be in control. No one wants to be the one that cares more and I’m calling bullshit. The only way to be happy is to take that chance. Just tell people.
Yes, you have left your residual energy in my life and I am forever changed, but I won’t shut down my feelings to protect or wait for complete honesty. I’ve waited and the distance was created. The pain was causing every muscle and thought to ache, literally being sick to my stomach at times. I deserve every ounce of love that can be given to me and so do you. That means that I have to make myself the priority and be concerned with my own emotions. If you stay in my life, hopefully we can grow closer and stronger. I love you all the way to my very core and there will always be a special spot for you, but it is time to love myself.
I’d probably be sick and on my deathbed and still be making passes at you.
Tears stream down my face as I’m standing on the coastline.  Cold waves washing up over my feet- forcing me back- reminding me that I’m… I’m only human and..  ..And I am nothing.. .. against this inexorable distance which separates us.  Or.. this relentless loneliness that devastates us… and..  ..This yearning is destroying me..    It’s sort of.. nostalgic, isn’t it, my sweetest love..  Laying next to you - separated by tides and plastic screens- watching your chest rise and fall with the quietness of your sweet breathing..  The life force that flows inside of you, the perfect existence that means everything to me -  I close my eyes and I’m taken back to the first time I saw you, and was breathlessly captivated by your beauty.  You were.. exquisite..  And from that moment - I knew it was you that I had been searching for.  I knew it was you who I wanted - forevermore.  I open my eyes to see you lying there, your hair fallen in your face as you try to fall asleep-  and again I find myself drowning in your perfection, my darling.  and again I find myself still so.. irrevocably in love with you..  Close my eyes once more, and I’m back to the first time I told you I loved you- I meant it with every fiber of my being, every breath inside of my lungs- every faint beat of my cold heart.  and.. these memories are on replay in my mind like a motion picture- and each time it takes me back to the start.  I never believed in soulmates- until now.  and.. I never believed in true-love until.. there was you.  And in hindsight.. I truly believe that it has always been you..  You pull me through time.  -E.M. 2015

The most important thing on my list of wedding/marriage stuff is the cake. Like I don’t want a whole big wedding thing (I’m not THAT cool with my fam and stuff) But I want a HUGE ass, delicious, fuckin wedding cake and I want a photographer there, specifically, to take pictures of me eating cake with my husband and me just throwing cake at him, us laughing just having a good time. Sigh. I want that cake every year on our anniversary.

I just want something to work out for me. Soon. But at the same time I want to wait for something super good to happen.
I don’t play very hard to get and then I wonder why they don’t chase me
I really feel like I’m not supposed to be in a relationship but I’m here to teach the people I date how to love… (Other people, obviously) 🙄

She’s fucking tired of the in-between.  She says “I’m either not shit,  or you make me feel like a queen. If I’m not the absolute woman of your dreams,  then there’s no need for you to rip me apart at the seams.”    He’s fucking tired of the abundant stress. He says, “Alright darling,  I’m just trying to do my best.  Everything in my life is a mess, I must confess, your childish ways are putting me under duress.”    She’s fucking tired of the unneeded burden. She says, “I’m carrying all this weight for what? An undecided fate?  If you’re not willing to form and create, then what’s the point. It seems like it’s too late.”    He’s fucking tired of the mass of confusion. He says, “Fate is just an illusion.  Nothing is definite, and nothing is fine. I can’t love a person who’s not even mine.”    She’s fucking tired of walking away. She says, “You haven’t even tried to make me stay!”   He’s fucking tired of being fucking tired.  He says, “I don’t know what you want from me.”   Being, is what she’s fucking tired of.
Reblog if you’re single this holiday season and low-key bumming about it I have a special message for you :)
It’s been a while since I have written something.  I guess the notion of writing down ones thoughts becomes more and more daunting the longer you put off writing them down.  Or I guess in this case typing them down.  I doubt many people bother to read this, but there is something about hoping that someone will see it and connect with my experiences and what I have to say.   Second year at university has been more of a emotional rollercoaster than my first. It was unexpected, I guess you hope that a year on - a year’s experience of certain people and a certain place would make you wiser and more accustomed to its requirements of you - but that is far from the case.   I guess I have felt like I am drowning in a pool of emotions and an excessive work load. I hate sounding melodramatic, but god university is a minefield, one wrong step and everything around you starts exploding in unexpected and undesired ways. Relationships become strained, you move further away from who you were and who you thought you could and would be.   I thought I would be doing a little better at life, but instead I feel like i am just moving further away from where I was. When life was far harder, I was succeeding more, but now rather than being me that is constantly getting damaged, it is my relationships with everyone else that are fracturing. I can’t seem to stay afloat.  I guess it is the relationships with people, friends, family that kept me going but now even those bonds you expect to stay strong are just as broken as those you see no hope in.   The number of people that have come into my life and played such a large role, impacting aspects of my life in ways that have changed me and my philosophy. But just as easily as they came along, they disappeared with equal ease. It is exhausting welcoming new friends and seeing old ones leave without so much as a goodbye. Or maybe it isn’t really a goodbye, but more the influence they had has impacted as much of me as it could have, leaving them with no more use; or more specifically leaving them with no more use for my friendship.   So the question springs to mind, what actually led me to start writing again. Well, it is that old story of the breakdown of a relationship between father and daughter, more predominately the breakdown of clashing philosophies and cultures. The thought of spending the christmas holidays alone, without those we call family for an action that one recognises as a wrong-doing, the other as just a teenagers night of debauchery.   This relationship that is supposed to bare this unconditional love and affection is in fact based entirely on conditions and requirements, which, if not met see a breakdown of any relationship between these two persons. It makes me question all relationships - they all seem entirely flawed in their foundations, and yet we crave them, why?  Emotional companionship? Physical desire? or is it the fear of ourselves?  I just feel like their is a constant desire to try to please those who we share conditioned and unconditional bonds with, without pleasing ourselves - and my conclusion to it all, is one simple question of why?
saying sorry over and over doesn’t make it better if nothing actually changes
According to Steven, making a large dinner last night even though he ate already at work (unbeknownst to me) was my own fault. If only I had decided to ask him how his day was would I have found out that he in fact ate already. Because at no point in time when I spoke to him on the phone when he got home did he mention anything when I asked him to take out the huge package of chicken breast. Nor did he say anything when I got home and began cooking. Also nothing when I said dinner will be ready after you leave for bball so you can eat then. I guess every day I’m supposed to ask a slew of questions to find out what may be different about today to figure out what I should do in certain circumstances. I think we should test this theory. I have a hunch that the first time I do something that affects him and my response is “oh I’m sorry maybe if you had asked about my day you’d know why I’m not home right now. Why would you just assume because I come home every other day around the same time that today I would do the same. Communication Steven. You should really just talk to me and figure out what’s going on.” He won’t like it much. He won’t realize how stupid he sounds. He’ll say something like oh so we’re going tit for tat. Smh. Why talk when it feels like comprehension isn’t possible…. I’m sorry my life is precious. I don’t plan on wasting my breath. He really should have just said sorry and offered to still clean the dishes. I officially boycotting cooking this week. He can cook (which he won’t) or buy fast food. You don’t bite the hand that feeds you. And seeing how I’m the one who makes dinner he really is fighting a losing battle.
when you don’t talk to the person you want to talk to all day, because you don’t want to feel in the way.
I will never envy my ‘exes’, I hope they all glo n become happy.
“And when you choose a life partner, you’re choosing a lot of things, including your parenting partner and someone who will deeply influence your children, your eating companion for about 20,000 meals, your travel companion for about 100 vacations, your primary leisure time and retirement friend, your career therapist, and someone whose day you’ll hear about 18,000 times.   Intense shit.”
I should know better than to allow myself to fall so quickly for someone. I really like him too but he still has feelings for someone else. It hurts more than I anticipated it too. This is why I do not get attach to people anymore.
Trying to figure out if our relationship problems started with his affair, or if I am using his affair to ignore my own internal struggles, depression and general unhappiness.
i think i’d like to fall in like a few more times before i fall in love.
You know your relationship’s good when you can act bat-shit crazy and your girlfriend/boyfriend isn’t embarrassed…or at most just has a regular face and doesn’t pretend that they aren’t dating you
It makes me sad when I hear/see people who I know are in relationships talk about/to other people like they aren’t in one. Like I don’t notice other guys because I have my guy..but I guess that’s not how it works now
Absolutely disgusting when people in relationships are manipulative, emotionally abusive and try to blackmail their partners into staying with them by threatening to commit suicide, saying “I’ll do this, that and the other”. If you’re that person then you seriously need help because you clearly don’t understand how much it can ruin a person.
This gorgeous girl took me out for ice cream and shisha and gave me her scarf and cigarettes and told me she really likes me (to the point where she was considering stopping talking to me bc feels? which I’ve never understood but ok) and she is the best and speaks fluent Arabic too (which is the coolest) and ahh I’m happy 😁
The day that she loves me back will be the day this dress rehearsal ends and my life begins proper.
I just don’t get it. Why don’t hot guys like ugly girls who have great personalities? They must be shallow and superficial.
In the solitude of the cold winter of London, I feel let down, lonely and betrayed by my own way to act. I cannot really understand how’s possible to make that kind of living, such miserable and misunderstood.  I cannot stand at seeing her without communicate, without having the possibility of sharing my thoughts and my life with a person I really feel in love to, I cannot stand to that. I really cannot.  I’m left on my own, without any kind of consolation, in the cold of my own arms I rest, without peace, without anyone to feel how wasted can be an human life, flying away, like a leaf in the middle of the autumn, abandoned by his tree, with the fate of flowing caressed by the wind, till death.  Are we really meant to love? Are we really meant to suffer for the lack of returned feelings, making ourselves getting weaker and weaker again, without any possibility to enjoy the ride of happiness.  Looking for happiness itself, all day, all nights, we cannot reach it, is it somewhere? Nope, for someone is just something dreamed and beloved, but impossible to reach, something that we will be never able to touch, or feel. Something that is out of our target. So it is, for me.  Dreaming is the only thing I can do, waiting for death in the condemn of my loneliness, the more I fight for life, the more I get let down, the more I need to rise again and suffer even more, drowning in sorrow.  I wished I could get rid of this feelings, and I was almost there, but almost, is sadly not enough, so we are, suffering again, hoping that one day all of these words are going to be only a sad public memory, that someone is gonna enjoy the reading, without feeling too much like I’m feeling now.  With a gun pointing at my soul, and the blade of a sharp golden knife stuck into my heart, I go on, in pieces that will probably never going to get together again.  I’m on fire, I’m on my way to run and fight against myself, another time, another day, to keep myself barely on my feet, during this foolish journey of emotions, during this circus of lost souls riding my corpse.  There’s no hope, for this sinner born under the flag of the lioness, to find peace for his wasted and worn soul, that is now impossible to get back. We are now here, warriors, died for our best wishes.
It seems like I’m destined to remain single from now on. I just have no luck these days.

…and held and told I’m “sexy” and “beautiful” again. I know I’ve really started to move on, but I still crave the physical aspect of a relationship. It made me feel so nice and loved and connected to him ~ However, there’s no way in hell I can do another relationship/a hookup right now. I’m not in the place for that. Unless Tyler magically changed his mind, but 1) I need to do me rn and 2) that’s honestly impossible at this point.
Soppy Tumblr update, so a lot of you may know this already but if you don’t, this time last year i was in a toxic relationship and my ex and her mum lied to the police saying i was ‘abusing her’ just to get me sent home, I had to go to court. stay in a cell over night and was put on the floor with handcuffs, my advice to you, never get in a position your other half is going to change you and make up such a lie like this as it abuses the policing system, My mum and my auntie drove all the way to Edinburgh to pick me up and bring me home as i got sent home on a plane, NEVER EVER let anyone do this to you, there are real people getting abused and beaten up out there and it is so fucking wrong to lie and to make up stories, in the end it was such a good thing to happen because I got home to my family the people who really care and have had an amazing 2015 compared to 2014, Life isn’t always easy but don’t let anyone ever put you in a position like that. all I need is family, friends and my band they all mean the world to me.
will there ever be a time where I don’t have some sort of guy drama? i’m starting to think it’s just a constant in my life

I know waiting is hard. Time drags on and you ask yourself, “When is it going to be my turn? When do I get my love story?” You become upset and impatient. You think maybe you expect too much and should lower your standards just a little. But this is not the answer. Ladies, you… A Reminder for the Single Ladies was originally published on The Papist
Relationships  Wyatt’s is always terrified to let people close due to the fact that they’ll normally be in constant danger from demons and other ‘evil’ beings that will want to use them to get to him. Along with that, he is also very scared of being rejected the moment he tells them who he is. Because of this, he is not likely to date much, if not at all, and will stick mostly to one night stands or short dates.
Relationships are mirror images of your own life, how you feel and treat yourself, as well as how you react and respond to different situations and people that are around you. All relationships whether they’re on an emotional, physical, mental, or spiritual level are all part of the learning process and enlightenment of the soul. No matter what category a relationship falls into, it acts as a teaching tool for you to understand the lessons that your soul needs to learn. It can help you to understand, change, or enhance your individual qualities. Every relationship is an opportunity for soul growth. Different types of relationships have an uncanny way of showing you where and what you need to work on in your life. At times, they reveal your vulnerabilities and insecurities, or your need for attention, approval, and acceptance. Equally, they can identify where you may be stuck in a rut, or where you need love, peace, healing, or joy in your life. Remember not all relationships have to be one-on-one with just one individual. They can be with a group, an organization, a pet, or even an incident or situation. <!-- more --> Some relationships are simply there for you to experience love or it could be a way of showing you what you don’t want in your next relationship. So when it’s time to develop a relationship, you’ll be more aware and have the ability to manifest the type of relationship you want – one that serves your highest purpose. Whatever the case, when you learn to open your heart and view a particular relationship through the eyes of your soul, you’ll discover an even better relationship that’s waiting for you – the relationship of your soul-self. This Week’s Lesson This week write down in your journal the relationships you’ve had in the past, and see if they’ve guided you in the direction of where you are now, or ask yourself whether they led you away from your purpose? On another page, write down all the relationships that are happening in your life right now. Ask yourself: “What am I learning from this relationship?” “What qualities am I developing?” “Is this relationship for my highest good?” “How can I make this relationship better?” “Are we learning from each other?” “What have I learnt or still learning about myself through this relationship?” “Are the people in my life empowering and encouraging me to be all that I can be?” Within every relationship, there’s an encoded lesson that You’ve hopefully learned or still need to learn. Have a SOUL filled week! By: John Holland

Writing is my outlet, so here I am, needing to express myself to no one because I’m too exhausted to express it directly to another human being. Let me start with a disclaimer: I LOVE that I am good at listening to people and helping them process what’s going on inside them and their perspective on the world around them. It is probably my favorite thing about my personality, and it’s in my nature, so there’s no changing that about myself. Here comes the but… However, I am simply spent. Drained. Running on empty.  Let me explain: My job every day is to reach out to individuals all over my city and assist them with what they need. A lot of the time, this means counseling as I am a mental health specialist on my team, but because I’m a social worker and my philosophy is that mental health is connected with all other aspects of life, it also means I help my clients with literally whatever else they need (within reason and within my code of ethics). The population I serve is those facing serious and chronic mental illness and often times substance use disorders - that means schizophrenia, severe mood disturbance, personality disorders, PTSD, cocaine, meth, alcoholism, etc. That’s tough stuff, and many of my clients are overwhelmed the majority of their days (of course they are; I would be too). Another disclaimer: Do not get me wrong, I absolutely love my job. It is extremely rare for me to not be excited about coming to work and doing my job to the best of my ability. I have fun at work everyday even if it’s a hard day. My coworkers rock and my clients brighten each day. My job is challenging and difficult a lot of the time, but it is SO rewarding - I cannot even express with words how rewarding.  But that does not mean I’m not human. I have my own needs and problems, and I need to maintain my own balance. This has been a learning process for me (and I think the same goes for most people in their 20s, becoming adults and learning about themselves and the world around them). As I said before, it is in my nature to want to help others above all else, which is great to an extent…until I forget to love myself first and foremost. Self-care is probably the most challenging aspect of my line of work, especially for me considering I struggle with anxiety and mood disturbance myself (mild to moderate and I have tons of coping skills and resources, don’t worry).  All this being sad, because my job can require me to give so much of myself to others, this means it is important for me to feel like others are giving to me in my personal life, rather than me always feeling like I’m the giver and my loved ones are the takers. Again, don’t get me wrong, I know those that love me would never mean to make me feel this way, and a lot of why I feel this way right now has to do with my thinking and attitude. But wow, do I not feel taken care of by some of the people in my support system right now. I will mention I’m spreading myself very thin and not taking care of myself as I should, so I do blame that quite a bit (which means I need to do better). Fortunately, a select few (the most important ones like my significant other, family, and closest friends) are helping me feel heard and cared for like I need right now. But god help me, it’s taken some strength to not give the ones I love who are self-centered right now a piece of my mind. I have had to respectfully set some boundaries with a couple people, and for that I am proud of myself. It’s a busy time of year, and everyone is stressed - I get that. My plan going forward is to get some rest and pay extra attention to loving myself in the next few weeks while I navigate the business of the rest of 2015. Perhaps my mind will feel less clouded by exhaustion tomorrow and even more so the next day.
There are people who say that platonic relationships aren’t as important as romantic relationships and they are wrong.
i don’t like it when people say ‘win you’ because honestly the idea of winning someone means you’ve accomplished your goal and you’re done, that now you can stop trying because you’ve completed your conquest. and that’s not what a relationship is, you don’t just do all this stuff to make someone fall in love with you just to quit when they do. people are not objects to win or lose. unlike a trophy, people are not content sitting on the mantle collecting dust.
please stop expecting so much from relationships, one person can’t handle all of ur emotional baggage when they have their own and wake up at 4am to listen to all of your issues while they have their own and surprise you with presents and gifts and expensive shit and cook for you and take you on ‘adventures’ and go out in the middle of the night with you and watch the stars with you and magically know when you want something or need something and like everything you like and spoon you all night (being the big spoon becomes v uncomfortable after a while and why should they be uncomfortable just for your sake??? like no) and love everything you do and agree with everything you say or think or do relationships just aren’t like that in reality and if they are then hOO LORDY NEVER LET THAT PERSON GO BECAUSE THAT PERSON IS PROBABLY NOT EVEN REAL
One of the books I have read this year, is Big Magic by Elizabeth Gilbert. This is the third book from her I`ve read, and it started with “eat, pray, love” that many have either read or watched. When I was done, it felt magical. I thought about my own life, and could relate to much of what she wrote.

Arguing with a woman is like being nibbled to death by a goose.
<!-- more --> I think I’ve gotten to a stage where I might be ready for another relationship. But I want it to mostly be in person and NOT on social media. I went 3 days with using any type of social media and let me tell you it actually felt amazing having so much time to myself. It doesn’t sound big, but for me it want a huge achievement and I think I’m ready for a relationship - but I want to date someone who lives close, someone that I can visit and see. But the problem is I’m not crushing on anyone.. Do you just ever feel like you’re in love with “love” its self? You just feel affectionate and happy and cute, that you want to share it with someone else.

Super weird. But kind of makes sense.  So I was at this place I think it was for a job or something? This was the first part so it’s foggy. But basically there were boats, like we were on the water. And Jesse ended up being there which surprised me at first but it ended up being fine.  And then my dad was there and I had no reaction except slight annoyance but that’s pretty mild. So we’re on this boat and he’s talking to me about “his wife” like he wouldn’t just call her Anna which was weird so I sensed he was kind of over her, or that her “new wife sparkle” was wearing off. And how his wife was forcing him to have a wedding ceremony with her daughters and he thought it was super awkward. I said it made him look like a pedophile but he didn’t get mad.  So then it’s the day of the wedding and I announced it for some reason and I said “here’s my dad marrying his other, better daughters” and my aunt (his sister) gasped and scowled at me. The ceremony was super weird like they were on this stage and everyone was standing on a hill looking at them, and there were basically giant tables made of cake that they dove into face first and I was talking to my grandma about how great it looked haha. Like sign me up.  And then I realize my aunt looks like she’s about to come talk to me about what I said so I’m like ok time to leave. So I start leaving and she follows me and tells me how inappropriate it was to say that and I just started yelling about how she should know better, because her dad died when she was young but mine just left me for them. And left me in hundreds of dollars in debt which he told me he would pay off but he never did, but suddenly his new family gets new iPhones and shit. And then I screamed at her “oh right but I just get upset at every little thing so that’s what this is, right? That’s what you said. This isn’t justified, it’s just me being irrationally upset at everything!!”  And then I woke up.  This one has a lot of more obvious symbols, like weddings/marriage are supposed to be about love and commitment, which he has for his new family but not for me.  And the way he talked to me, like everything was fine and the way it used to be, which is something I wish for. That part of my dream was nice. He was being honest and real. And it was like he was his old self. But obviously that’s going to stay fantasy.  I think the first part had some characters from Lie to Me in it… I’ve been watching the show a lot so that’s probably where that came from.  And then Jesse and I had no weird feelings or awkwardness when we talked, which is a point I hope we get to. I actually have dreams and daydreams where I meet Jesse and his girlfriend and it’s totally cool. I honestly have no hard feelings toward either of them, and I want them to be happy (I kind of want to see them together so I can see what he looks like in a happy relationship).  And the part with my aunt is obviously how I wish I could confront my passive aggressive family. She thinks I need to be happy for my dad no matter what he does, because he’s always the victim in everything and blah blah blah. And they think I’m irrationally upset at everything which really hurts. I want to be able to yell like that. But I can’t.
Love is defined by authenticity It isn’t extravagant expectations but enjoying simplicity A matter of actions, words, expressions, it can really depend But love for me, is having a two in one soul mate and best friend. Love means to hold hands with someone and smile with pride Because you’re pursuing your ambitions by each other’s side. Love is a shared moment that you want to outlive Receiving with appreciation and giving with no ulterior motive.  Love is screwing up occasionally, Then learning what’s right But mistakes don’t change your will to fight. Lovers stand together, for what they believe in On each other’s behalf  To capture infinite words in a single photograph. To shelter you when it rains and make you laugh. To stick by you on a similar path. To make you smile, to share a song When everything seems to be going wrong. And each person will have a different view But this how I define love from what I’ve been through.

So, I finally feel I’m in an okay place to write this piece I’ve been planning for months. I’m not okay by any means, but I think I’m good enough to write this; the wounds are healed enough but still open enough for me to write this objectively yet still keep it real. This is part one of my analysis on ‘Relationships ruining Fandoms.’ All my usual warnings apply: This is MY analysis, not hard fact. If you follow my random postings, you’ll know that I’m in the process of divorce. It was a big reason I started this blog, so that I had something to distract myself with. So keep that in mind as you read this. I will try VERY hard not to bash any fans or fandoms, but it might happen. If it does, consider this my apology in advance. Our fandoms define who we are as people, and as fans. That is a topic for the second part of this series. However, I must touch on it a slight bit here. Our fandoms define who we are as people, and so influence who we meet, and who we become friends with. No, not everyone we meet is in a fandom, but we all have those relationships that formed out of a shared connection to a fandom.  Humans make connections all the time. Connections to people, places, things, animals and even sounds or scents, so it makes sense that we connect deeply with our fandoms and the people in them, but like any connection, our inter-fandom connections must be nurtured. They may evolve into role-play partnerships, friendships, romantic relationships, enemies, those people who you only hear from at major holidays, or any combination thereof. If they work out, great, but what if they don’t? If they don’t, there’s always a risk of memories ruining the fandom. It may not happen right away, you may find yourself months or years later driving to work and having to pull over in tears because a song reminds you of your hurt; or suddenly needing to cull your fandom related collection in your anger over it. It’s all natural and part of how humans grieve. Time will lessen the pain. For instance, I can read Hellsing now, five years after the fiasco that was the related relationship, but I can’t watch Steven Universe…heck, I have a few songs on my Ipod that I can’t listen to.  The works that inspire the fandoms we join become parts of ourselves, parts of our hearts and souls, which we share with others. We’ve all felt the joy of sharing our fandoms with a friend who has never seen/read/heard of them before, and the crushing feeling when they don’t like them as much as we do. Sharing fandoms with people is a great way to find someone who likes them as much as you do, but that sharing is a double edged blade. Much like relationships based on fandom, memories can ruin a fandom that is near and dear to the heart. I can get through it, but watching the first Lord of the Rings is much harder now, and not because of the length. I haven’t even looked at my DVD copy of Dorian Gray in months. I’m going to leave this as a TO BE CONTINUED before I start ranting even more about how broken I am and the fandom bashing starts…Part Two coming eventually…
I’m here don’t you know?  Waiting. Hoping. Wishing. That you’ll let me come to  your rescue.  All those girls hurt you, I hurt you.  But I stayed, through all the darkness, The passionate times. I stayed.  I’m here don’t you know?
every guy i’ve dated eventually starts to lose interest and begins treating me as a convenience and this sounds so dramatic and it’s such a shitty way of thinking but i really can’t imagine anyone ever caring about me the way that i do for them and it’s just really making me wonder what’s wrong with me that they always eventually pull away from me once they get to know me?
after such a good evening celebrating our six months, we smoked out of my new double bowl and went to go to sleep and I ask him to plug my phone in for me. next thing I know, he’s going through my phone. I thought we agreed when we got back together that we would trust each other and not go through each other’s stuff. so now I’ve spent all day upset because I feel like he can’t trust me and I completely went a mile further away from being comfortable with him again.

Maple talks to me everyday, he tells me he misses me, stuff like that. Skater texted me maybe twice yesterday then fell off the face of the planet again. How can I compare them? Each has his own pros and cons. Which means neither are right. But I think I am for sure going to take a break from online dating at this point. In fact I will delete all my apps right now.  Ok, they’re all gone. Disabled, not permanently deleted. But the apps are off my phone at least. No more scrambling for my phone at 12 looking for a bagel. Also, while maple was telling me about how his legs were so sore from skiing, I was like oh I could probably give you a leg massage, if you fly back here. And he’s like, or I could fly you to Toronto. And put you up in a hotel. I think he was kind of drunk but coherent enough to think about it. And then he called me and pretty much said the same thing. Now he’s all like, I worked for 4 years, I have money. And I’m like ehhh…  Like on one hand, how exciting. And how flattering? But on the other hand… I would feel terrible. Like I’m glad he’s so sure that he wants this to work out (even if I don’t believe him, because he’s probably still in the rebound phase) but I’m not sure if it will. I would like it to. But there are a couple of hills to get over… and Idk if I have the strength or the will to persevere. He’s good, but there might be some dealbreakers along the way. Which is why, for once, I really want to take it slow. Although I guess now that we’ve engaged with the physical aspect, I’m not really in a rush to go anywhere emotionally. I guess I might still be guarded.  Yup, his breakup is so fresh. They’re still at the splitting friends stage. Anyway… it would be crazy to have him fly me to toronto and put me up in a hotel for new years… and have him cuddle me. But it feels so wrong. Like this isn’t something you do for someone 3 dates later, no matter how strongly you feel. And I would feel awful because I think he has stronger feelings at this point than I do… I guess this is how my ex felt when we went on break and I wanted to call him all the time? I guess I’d been harboring those feelings for him for a long time and he’d only just considered seeing me in that light… and it wasn’t a good match.

I know what Liam is like. I know he manipulates me. I know he’s aggressive. Yet I put myself in the same position time and time again.  On Sunday Liam messaged me saying he needed someone to talk to. My house is horrendous at the moment and I was longing for an excuse to escape for a bit so I went along. With the very best of intentions might I add to not let myself be brainwashed, to ask him for some money back etc etc. But I don’t know how he does it. I was desperate for a drink and he had wine and I couldn’t resist it. Weak I know. Then he’s telling me all his problems with his ex and the kids and I feel really sorry for him. Then he starts getting mad shouting and throwing shit because he’s so frustrated which I understand but he just frightens me. I gave him a hug in an attempt to calm him down and then get whispered in my ear… “Let me fuck you.” I pulled away but then he starts kissing me and I go with it because I know it’ll be worse if I say no. He just gets a glazed look over his eyes which is terrifying. I didn’t dare say no so it’s my own fault! I can cope with the pain to a certain extent but he threw me on the floor and I was just silently crying. Sorry for the long post. I desperately needed to get that all off my chest. Hate keeping secrets.

You were the first person I dated who I actually trusted was interested in me. I had no doubts you liked me and wanted to be with me. You were also the first person I dated who really had their shit together, I felt like I was in a real adult relationship for once. You took me out on real dates, you drove us places, my family thought you were nice, our friends liked each other, you invited me to holiday dinners, you waited for me to get into my house before driving away, you texted me frequently… You did all the things a good significant other is supposed to do. I was happy with you and with us. But then something changed. Life happened, I got depressed and couldn’t hide it. I wasn’t perfect, but I wouldn’t say I really took it out on you. I was honest with you and told you I push away people I care about when I get sad. I did everything I knew how to do to feel better; I took my vitamins, I was eating better, I was working out, I was sleeping as well as I could, I was journaling, I was seeing my counselor, I was faking it when I had to. But still, it wasn’t enough for you. The day you broke up with me I knew it was going to happen. You came up with every excuse in the book instead of “I am no longer attracted to you and can’t handle dating someone who is depressed.” That’s what hurts the most. Instead of being man enough to be honest, you lied. I saw you on OkCupid a couple of weeks ago and that’s when I realized you truly are a piece of garbage who wasted my time. It still hurts though, how someone could just stop liking me for god knows why. But I am trying to remember that I’m better off without someone like you in my life.

Im home for break now and my mama told me to go cut up some herbs for this lunch we’re puttin together for some guests later today. So im standing in my kitchen at home and im choppin basil leaves and makes strange noises and singing and i just feel really happy. And then i think, “i could share this. I could share this goofy happy with someone else. If i lived with someone, if i was a wife or an almost-wife… i could share a kitchen with someone and make silly noises while i chop basil leaves. And they could smile at me for being so goddarn weird and not being able to do anything about it and feeling so strangely lucky that they get to be with a girl who is in her own little world while cutting greens for lunch.”  I dont know if this is a cute thought or what, but i thought i’d record it.
It’s not about not being able to move on, It’s about not wanting to make the same mistakes again. So this time around, I’m going to be extra careful. I’m going to make sure that when I give my heart to somebody, they won’t throw it back at my face. –L.K. // electronicink.tumblr.com

Golf has become a sport played all around the world, from the United States, to Scotland, to New Zealand, to China. According to the National Golf Foundation, in the United States alone as of 2005 the number of people who play golf twenty-five times or more a year is 4.6 million. Also, as of 2008, the United States is home to 17,672 golf courses. There is also a growing number of professional golf followers. But why has golf becomes such a widespread phenomenon, with the numbers of people playing increasing every year? Well, it’s because there are many benefits to playing golf and it’s fun! It can improve your health Spending a day in the sun playing golf is a great way to stay healthy, as long as you are wearing sunscreen! Research has shown that golf is good for your health in multiple different ways. It helps you to relax and relieve stress, burn calories without partaking in rigorous activity, and keep your heart healthy. Anyone can play the sport While golf may be difficult to learn at first it is not very difficult to pick up and is a sport that anyone of any age can play. It is one of the most accessible sports for all ages. For those that may be a bit younger or older and can’t play at the same level as the others they are competing against, they can play with a handicap to make the playing field more fair. It’s always challenging  One of the best things about golf is that it is always unpredictable. Depending on the weather and the course your game will be different every time. These conditions even affect the best professional players. Even if you play the same course multiple times you know that the game will always be different and challenging, which keeps the game exciting. Helps you build relationships Golf is one of the best sports for building relationships in your personal life and business life. Some games of golf last around 4 hours, which is an ample amount of time to form a relationship with someone that you’re playing with. Golf can be as competitive or as friendly as you want it to be, which makes it the perfect thing to do with a business associate. You don’t necessarily want to be in an intense competition with someone that you are hoping to do business with. Playing a friendly round of golf can help you forge that business relationship. Another way to create friendships through golf is by joining a country club. Many golf enthusiasts join clubs in order to play with others who enjoy the sport as much as them and to build relationships with these people. A country club is a great social place for golf lovers to come together.
She sat on the couch and searched for missing the remote, tears streaming down her pale face, she needed the one thing that could give her silence. The glossy shine from the plastic remote glowed from under the coffee table and taunted like a small child. She clicked the T.V. off and laid her head back on the couch’s arm anticipating the numb blackness of sleep. Moments later, a knock emanated from the front hallway. “Come in.” She echoed, slightly hoarse. Her boyfriend of two and a half years waltzed through the front door and into the living room with a radiant smile on his face. His smile faded quickly when he spotted her teary eyes. He knelt down beside her and offered her his hand. Her hand fit so well in his, like two pieces of a puzzle. She waited a moment to see what he would do, He kissed her hand and stood, signaling for her to follow. He lead her by the hand into the pristine white bathroom lined with fluffy blue towels. He leaned over the tub and turned the faucet far to the left. He knew I liked the water hot. She stood watching his movements as he got shampoos and salts and… rose petals. She wondered where he had gotten them. He poured things into the tub and gestured for her to step in. She looked down at her clothes and blushed. She knew he assumed she would be undressing while he was preparing the bath. She suddenly became embarrassed. He looked back at her and smirked. He slowly, but modestly, peeled away her clothes. As he helped her step into the bathtub he saw a beauty that rarely saw int he modern world. She had a beautiful body, but her heart defined her more so than any curves. At that moment he looked at her in awe, quickly remembering the task at hand. He saw her aching heart beneath it and began mending her internal wounds. He asked about her day and waited for the tears to once again, pour down her lovely face, but she did not weep. She didn’t shed a single tear. Instead, she smiled and kissed his hand.  “I was put down because I’m a modest woman, but then it hit me. If I wasn’t, than I wouldn’t have you.” He smiled and kissed her forehead with tears of his own. (I wrote this after thinking about my relationship goals)

You don’t have to punish yourself when other people treat you negatively. A lot of people are very sick. People will destroy your self esteem and dehumanize you just so they can feel alive. Other people’s negative opinions of themselves do not need to be projected on to you. If you’re looking for a sign to leave an unhealthy relationship in the past, this is it trust me. I spent a year ignoring my friends and family but they knew what was best for me all along. It hurt at first, it hurt a lot. But now I’m finally getting better.
So I told someone I know that they were being potentially cheated on for almost 2 years by a guy who is also dating someone else I know.   Basically I told Person B that person C is cheating on them with Person A. I felt like if I knew this I shouldn’t keep it secret, to be a good friend to people overall you should tell them about something so serious, especially since Person A in their own words said they didn’t care about being the other person or being in a cheating relationship despite person B not knowing at all.    And this is now the type of response and abuse I am receiving from Person A on messaging services Essentially, Person A got caught cheating, and now they’re experiencing the backlash of it. Yes they may not have been ‘caught’ if it wasn’t for me, but that doesn’t make it ‘okay’ to cheat.
He made me feel less cynical about things like love and relationships and marriage. All my life I’ve had every reason to believe that nothing good comes out of these things. I’ve seen relationships and marriages fail more times than I can count. I always thought, why would I wanna take that risk? Why would I wanna put myself in that position? I understand now. Sometimes you get so caught up in the idea of love that nothing else matters. It doesn’t matter if you get hurt and it doesn’t matter if you become unhappy because at least you could say for once in your life that you loved someone completely.
Hi, yes you reading this… Fall in love with me, Eat my pussy,  Kiss and caress my ass, Read me poetry, Suck on my tongue,  Feed me tacos, Go 2 the zoo w/me and hug me while I cry , Take me to the beach and squeeze on my ass while people pass by, I’m not asking for much.
Do you ever just lie down and position your arm in a certain way where it feels like they’re holding you
Loving or being loved by someone shouldn’t hurt… yes, relationships aren’t perfect but love shouldn’t be a constant struggle. If you’re loving someone and you’re in constant pain, that’s a great indication that you’re not loving them right. If someone is saying they love you but all you feel is confusion and pain then that’s a great indication that they’re not meeting your needs; that they aren’t loving you in the ways you need to be loved. And if you can’t love them without being in pain, then just know it isn’t your responsibility to love them. It’s your responsibility to love yourself… so don’t stick around just because you feel an obligation for you are under no obligations to love another person. It is not selfish to leave. It is not selfish to distance yourself. Just don’t be a dick about it while you’re in the process of understanding yourself. Express to them why you’re leaving or distancing yourself and try to avoid pointing the finger at them. If they can’t understand and or refuse to understand then that’s their decision. It will always be painful to leave or distance yourself from people… but sometimes it’s the best thing you can do for yourself and inevitably for them too. You can’t fully love someone when you don’t know what love is. And love is not pain.
Written By: Melissa Hughes Paper found in: The Weekender - a free weekly editorial found in NEPA Date of Newspaper: Vol. 22, Issue 57, December 16-22, 2015 In a galaxy not so far away, two people find each other and decide to start dating. As a new relationship begins, you find yourself getting to know the other person on a deeper level. You may discover they are interested in things you have no clue about. They may begin making cultural references and jokes that you don’t understand, which can lead to a strain on the relationship. When it comes to your new relationship, how strong is The Force with this one? Is he the Luke to your Leia (minus the whole sibling part)? If you are not into the “geek culture,” how can you ever love a fan boy? <!-- more --> When getting into my current relationship, I learned that my beloved and I had very different interests. He was more “Game of Thrones” and Zelda, where I was more “Sex and the City” and Netflix. How could this ever work? We had very little in common on the surface. Me? Interested in things at which I previously turned my nose up? In the words of Count Dooku: “I sense a great fear in you Skywalker. You have hate, you have anger, but you don’t use them.” I had no interest in getting into these things of his at all. Fear is the path to the dark side after all. It wasn’t until we got to know each other better that we began to share our differences and build differences and build bridges between our clashing ideas of fun. We sat together and watched each other’s shows. We explained why we liked certain scenes or related to the characters. We learned to find a mutual respect for each other’s quirks. I fell deeply in love with this boy and although I never was able to fully get on board with all of his favorite things, I slept through most of “The Matrix” series and have never brought myself to sit through the 20 hours of “Avatar,” i did embrace his other interests. It certainly wasn’t one sided either, he also embraced my own breed of nerd girl culture. We can now spend a weekend together binge watching our shows, while we pain pictures together (a deep love of mine) and drink wine. So how do you love a fan boy? You need to embrace your inner fan girl and let go of the preconceived notion of what you thought these things might be. I never thought I would be interested in “Game of Thrones,” it seemed excessively violent and manly, but now it’s one of my favorite shows. I am forever grateful he shared his passion with me and that it is something we can enjoy together. It is important that we each still have our own passions, but being able to bridge our loves together has brought us closer. Those surface ideas that I had about things never being compatible, turns out were just new interests that I hadn’t yet discovered. So give your partner’s interests a change. You may find out that you are more alike than you ever imagined. May The Force be with you.
Oh and also smidge o’ tmi, the daredevil ep we were watching finished and we both basically ran down stairs and the phrase one thing led to another doesn’t capture the hot af urgency of the sex that was just had. it has just been a FANTASTIC NIGHT
This year I cannot even muster up a bit of care for Christmas. In the past the holidays have been bearable, with an inevitable let down. This is the first year that (mind you, a childless couple) we will be at home on Christmas and not running between multiple houses. Despite my happiness at that, all of my other worries and fears outweigh the single positive.  Should I leave? Does he really love me? Is he willing to work on this? Can I live my life, knowing what the past years have been like? Am I brave enough to do it?
I wanted to hold his hand…why did I want to hold his hand? This is not me.
Jealousy. It’s running through me. Hot through my veins and branching through my cheeks. Blood-rush. I feel like my skin is porcelain, and I’m cracking, crumbling at the edges. I have this feeling like water is just going to pour out of my eyes. The bottom rim, full and heavy. Constant. I have this tingling. As if there are ants crawling up and down. Neck. Arms. Shoulders. As if I can feel their little feet, sensitive to every sensation - prick, prick, prick - into my pores and then they’re stuck, but only temporarily. Less than a second and they’re back on track again. Heavy breathing and upwards eye motions because I can’t help but think this may let me look into my mind and let me find the answers to my question… do I even know what it is? No, but I know I’m confused - and that calls for questions, doesn’t it? I had spent this entire time convincing myself this and convincing myself that - that I didn’t and that I did. I don’t think you ever realise how strong your feelings are, or how much someone means to you until it all goes to shit. I thought I had stopped. I thought I was over it - over him, but I’m not. And, I don’t think I ever truly could be. It’s amazing how strong a connection with someone can last and yet, I feel so pathetic saying this because we were never intimate, we never even shared a kiss. But I’m so into his person. I just keep playing his words in my mind over and over in my head, “We just click. We know each other so well.” We had drifted apart since then. It was minor - but I noticed. We stopped sharing things with each other as often and I knew he had become uninterested, but recently we’ve talked. About everything to do with us, about feelings and about limits. I felt so much closer with him, once again and that had just heightened my attraction. I suppose it was him clearing his tracks - exposing everything before his next chapter with her. That seems fair, but I can’t help but be jealous. Truth be told, I’ve begun to lose interest in him, but I’m just dwelling on the past. They happened so fast, why couldn’t I have been so honest with him, then? He felt it and I felt it, but I didn’t tell. This time around, he did, but not to me.
I personally feel like we as a community have gone from one extreme to the other, where the former was letting others treat us like shit, and the latter is immediately shutting out anyone who does something wrong. While this is a stage of self-empowerment and self-prioritization, I don’t think this new extreme is healthy. Yes, if anyone treats you badly you shouldn’t put up with shit behavior. But completely shutting out others who make mistakes only leaves room for isolation. Every person you meet will make a mistake in some way or another. What we need to learn is not to steel our hearts, but to set boundaries. This person fucked up? Ok, let them know, communicate and tell them why what they did wasn’t ok. They refuse to apologize or acknowledge their mistake? They wanna pin the blame on you? THEN stop fucking with them, because that’s when you see their true colors. Not necessarily in their actions, but in their reactions.  Immediately shutting out others makes us close our ears to different perspectives. Why they did what they did, how they feel, etc. This doesn’t mean you have to prioritize other people’s perspectives or feelings, not at all. Just be open to them.  In relationships with others, there must be balance. Don’t let others walk all over you, and don’t let yourself be so rigid with others that you end up isolating yourself, because no one is perfect. This doesn’t mean you must keep letting others get away with shitty behavior because “oh, everybody makes mistakes”. It means you must be able to recognize your boundaries, recognize when a line has been crossed, and weigh it against the matter at hand and whether what’s taken place is worth forgiving or not.  We are houses. Take care of your home. Don’t let everyone walk in and crash on the couch and trash the place, but also don’t shut yourself inside your home. Sometimes it is necessary that we visit other people’s homes and see their stories as well.  I hope this makes sense hahahah. But yeah, here’s my take on relationships with people.
Not even a speeding ticket. Though, that would make sense. Someone in his position would have to be entirely clean. But Jameson is too clean, at least to Beth. He is too nice, too perfect to not be fucked up in some way. Her suspicions were proven correct when he got his adopted son acquitted of an armed robbery charge. If Bethany had been in his shoes, she would have let the boy suffer, it would have taught him a lesson and not shone a light on the Cordova-Kents that drew journalists like her to it. She is determined to shine a light on Jameson’s shady dealings, there’s no way that someone could be that clean. There had to be some infraction, something more than what he was presenting to the world. She knew it.
What can I say  We’ve been such a long way What can I do Other than love you What can I say  When my head’s turned away What can I do  When I feel so confused  What can I say  When I see you every day What can I do  When I’ve begun to get tired of you What can I say When I can’t get my way  What can I do  When I don’t want to hurt you What can I say If I choose to walk away  What can I do  Because I don’t want to leave  What can I say  Other than you make my day What can I do Other than love you  What can I say  We’ve been such a long way
She has no words for this disgusting lump of a man. He could have had so much more but he let his feelings get involved. She laughs at his attempt to claw his way back to the top. He’s not smart about it either. If his boss doesn’t catch on sooner, Bethany would gladly tell her herself. What’s life without a journalist causing chaos? But Vaughn…. She wonders if he knows that she wants to stab him in the face with her stiletto. Probably not. The man can’t see two inches in front of his face.
Not many people disgust Bethany.  Well, actually, that was a lie.  But there was something about Evan that just repulses her. She can somewhat understand his wanting to be kept out of the spotlight, but everyone treats him like some big dirty secret. Of course she’s thought about the hit that Nadia Rousseau’s secret little brother would be with her boss, but she’s got bigger fish to fry than him. And besides, she can just add him into the story anyway. He never said that anything was off the record.
Do you ever find somebody who you’d probably really like if their ONE FLAW was anything else but it happens to be SUPER problematic to you?
He calls me “ Ms. Thickums” :-)
Life is weird and talking about stuff is hard…. but not talking about it is harder….
when am I going to get over this? am I ever going to be okay? it’s been so long already, long enough to see I’m the only one who hasn’t moved on… why am I still emotionally attached to the wellbeing of a person who could care less about mine?
My housemate and I were having a discussion about what an earth we’d do if we broke up with our other halves and he said the saddest thing. And baring in mind he’s really not the kinda guy to talk about his feelings, he said, “if she broke up with me, I think that would be it for me, cause nobody could ever match her. Nobody would ever be her, so I don’t think there’d be any point.”

It bothers me to no end when I see a certain un-named person get too involved in other people’s relationships, but refuses to take a hard look at their own. I care very, VERY deeply about this person, so when I see them destroy friendships and personal relationships because they don’t like the other person’s significant other or their relationship choices, I want to scream.  This person is and has been involved in a highly dysfunctional relationship for several years now. They seem to expect a pat on the back a gold star for staying committed to their partner through all this time, but refuse to admit that neither one of them are doing any good for the other person.  I’ve been on the receiving end of this person’s wrath when it comes to my own romantic relationships, and I’ve been on the receiving end of their wrath when I’ve turned the tables with a “how dare you judge me so harshly when you should really be looking in the mirror.”  My opinion is simply this: my perception of someone else’s relationship should have no bearing on their relationship. My perception does not see the whole dynamic. I can’t tell what feelings exist between two people, I can’t see what connection those two people may or may not have with each other. I am not in that relationship, so therefore, it is simply none of my business. (There are very few exceptions to this, such as cases of domestic violence.)  Sure, I can have my opinions regarding other people’s relationships based on what I see, but much like religion and politics, it is -never- my place to impose those opinions on someone else. And I should never sacrifice -my- relationship with someone simply because I don’t approve of their relationship with someone else.  I just really wish more people thought the way I do. It pains me to see someone sacrifice so many of their relationships with friends and family members because they choose to judge others before fixing their own problems. Especially when that someone is my own flesh and blood.
It’s four a.m. and I can’t fall asleep because you’re all I’m thinking about
shit. starting to have the “i miss him” feels again…
What I want is for something serious, something that when asked would always be the go to answer. What I’m talking about of course is you. I want to be free of fear, hatred and sorrow for as long as I can be and just be with you.
Beth’s first impression of Dante was “this was someone who could get her to the top”. She knew his reputation, the reputation of the newspaper. She aced the interview, her high college scores and charming demeanour boosting her up higher than the rest of her colleagues. She tried not to smirk as she breezed passed them after the interview. The Telegraph was supposed to be her ticket to showing everyone that she was something more than what they thought. It was supposed to show the world that she was a serious journalist, that she was more than her money and her looks.  It was supposed to be a lot of things that it wasn’t.  She lasted about three months before her self control started to scratch away. With each piece about the royal family, and Nadia Rousseau, she found herself wanting to commit a mass murder just so she could write about it while in prison. Nothing good ever happened, or when it did, Dante made sure to keep her as far away from the action as possible. That was when Graeme Cordova-Kent committed armed robbery and got away with it. Her passion was flamed anew, giving her a new source of inspiration and determination. She was going to write the tell all to end all tell all. To reveal the corruption in the police force, so much so that they would take a bribe from two of the most spotless people on this earth. She knew something was going on but when she presented it to Dante, he shot her down. Her opinion of Dante diminished after that. Sure it had been low before, but that was the proverbial straw that broke the camel’s back. She knew what she had was a groundbreaking, exciting story and opportunity for her to prove to everyone what she had been trying to prove for years. She is still determined though. Dante was just the editor, there had to be someone above him that she could go to with this story.
Most people would have been awestruck to meet a prince. Most people would have fawned head over heels for him. And no matter how good her façade was, Bethany could not see the appeal of the prince who had approached her. Their arrangement was simple: she was a booty call for him. He was a direct line to the royals 24/7 for her. Of course she let him think that he is in charge. She lets him text first, they never rang each other. They never went outside her apartment, or his bedroom together. Occasionally, if she was feeling particularly risky that day, they would find themselves in a public setting, seeing how far they could push before the other broke under the pressure. But Bethany was the ice queen. Feelings were foreign to her unless they were spite, determination, or anger. She had had her string of lovers in the past, a girl like her had needs of course. But there had never been a bigger scoop than the one that was presented by Andrew and the royals. This dance was one she knew inside and out. And she was determined to win.
I’ve just spent all day drinking tea and talking to a friend. We’ve been in pretty constant contact via texts and social media but this is the first time we’ve been in the same room for almost a year. Communications with my friends on social media generally go something like this: Friend: ‘Just back from… Laugh Out Loud – Digital Relationships was originally published on The Spark
#GuestPost: What Your Girlfriend Wants, But Would Never Ask For… My brain is gradually turning into mush because of all the holiday food and wine I get to enjoy. That’s why I haven’t been as regular on the blog, but I’m noting it all down. Lool… First of all, I should apologise for #OnTheHustle, the series would be back next year, I promise. I have a wonderful line up but I feel like, they would be lost in all the holiday madness. It would do them great… View On WordPress
So yesterday my girlfriend got called into her PE office for self harm scars.  Her teacher asked if people knew about them. She said yes.  Her teacher asked if she’d repeat it. She said no.  Her teacher asked for proof. And she showed him a picture of us together.  Baby girl, I’m not gonna be able to protect you from all of the bad thoughts but I’m going to try as hard as possible. I love you to pieces. I’m still struggling with my own problems, I’m not eating yet, but you’re helping. I ate yesterday because you were there.  We’re gonna help each other through this.
