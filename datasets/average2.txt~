 I work at a summer camp. Several weeksago we had our only group of high schoolers. On the first morning, one of my friends, a fellow counselor, pulls a hs boy up to me and demands the kid remove his hat. Once removed, I see that he has shaved his head, except for an arrow shaped strip, which he has dyed blue.

An older man sitting at a table close to me noticed the parents looking rather frustrated and walked over to the little boys.

 Today, while riding the lift on the ski mountain with my best friend, we saw a dad at the bottom of the hill yelling "GO DORA! You can do it!" We then looked up the hill to see a little girl cautiously making her way down the hill. Soon all the people on the lift, including my best friend and I, were cheering on Dora. Dora did an excellent job getting down the hill, and I\'m convinced it\'s because of us.  .      '

 Today I had to do an ICT exam and after I finished I had a few minutes to spare. So I thought to myself "cough if you are reading my mind." The next thing I know half of the hall starts having a coughing fit. Now I have to be careful about what I think.\r      ' 
 A couple of weeks ago I went to camp. I found this HUGE stick and decided I was Lord Voldemort. A camp counselor found a super tiny stick, and acted as if he was Dobby. Guess who is going back to that camp for a long, long time.       '

 Usually our teacher has us do practice work that he puts on the board in the beginning of class. Today when I walked in, there were only three squiggly lines drawn on the board. When the class started, our teacher said, "Today, instead of doing practice problems, I want you to talk about which one of these squiggly lines you think is the most attractive." Needless to say, we spent the whole class period discussing why line 2 looked better than line 1.  .     '

 Today in Home Ec, we we were tasting regular vs. low-fat coffee cake. No one was told who made which cake, so people throughout the room said things like, "I\'m pretty sure I made Cake A" and "I\'m pretty sure our group made Cake B."

 The other day in technology applications, a girl in our class found a video in Photo Booth of the girl who used that computer listening to her music and surfing the web. Apparently she didn't know that she was recording herself because she was getting really into her music and singing along and everything. Someone outside in the hallway notified everyone watching the video that the girl in it was coming down the hall to our classroom. So what do we do? My friend whipped out her USB flash drive and expertly moved the video onto it all in under 20 seconds so we could finish watching it later. Nerd ninjas? I think yes.       " 
 Today, my cousin and I went to our local mall. While my mother and my aunt looked at shoes, my cousin and I sat down on these blocks of stone. We soon enough realized that we were sitting in the display ( where they usually have mannequins). We decided to pretend to be mannequins and follow the people passing by, with our eyes. This one woman got freaked out. She then proceeded to run away and show the rest of her family. By then we were in hysterics and couldn't keep up the facade.  .\r (1/7/2011)     " 
 Today,(actually a while ago), me and my friend were having a Harry Potter duel using pencils as our wands. We were out in the hall saying spells back and forth,when a random teacher we do not know comes up to us saying "were you two doing harry potter?" Expecting to be yelled at we softly said yes.

 Today, while getting groceries with my Grandpa, I saw Oatmeal with Dino Eggs that hatched into little dinosaurs while they were heating up. I told my Grandpa about how I used to love that Oatmeal, because I loved the little dinosaurs because they added more flavour to it sometimes. I asked if we could get me a box of it, and he mentioned that I never eat Oatmeal anymore. So, I told him he wouldn't have to worry about me not eating this kind, because I'd be too excited waiting for the eggs to hatch while it's heating up in the microwave, and to find out if all the eggs hatched after I take the bowl out. And, I had to remind him that one of the only ways to find out if they all hatched, is by eating the Oatmeal. Guess who now gets to test if all the eggs hatched every morning before school this week?  .     "

 Yesterday, I met my boyfriend\'s father for the first time. He was saying how he was glad to be single because women were so difficult, and if he really needed something, he\'d get a blow up doll.
