<p>Hi,</p>
    <p>In this task, you will be given a diary entry written by someone who
    might be sad or in distress. Your task is to write a response (around 100
    words) that will make them feel better.</p>
    <p>To help/train you, here is an example situation</p>
    <p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
    <h3>Situation:</h3>
    <p>My boyfriend wanted me to go with him to visit his father for his
    Birthday. I could not make it because I had to work. Now we haven't spoke
    for 12hrs.</p>
    <h3>Thought:</h3>He is disappointed with me and he will stop wanting this
    relationship.
    <h3>Feeling :</h3>Sad, Unhappy 
    <p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
    <p>It might help you here to think of some logical errors in their
    statement. For example here they are mind reading - Jumping to conclusions
    about another person's thoughts, feelings, or intentions without checking
    them out.</p>
    <h3>Here is an example of a good response :</h3>
    <p>Your boyfriend may be upset with you, but you know he cares about the
    things you do with him. You can make it up to him to show that you care.
    Sometimes we need to prioritize and it's okay to make up for things at a
    later time. Perhaps making up for it may be more worthwhile. Have you asked
    why he is silent? It may be for a completely different reason. If it is
    because you couldn't take the time off to meet his dad then ask why it is
    making him feel so bad that he doesn't talk to you. You might understand
    each other's reactions better then.</p>
    <h3>Now a bad response :</h3>
    <p>Send him a text to let him know you're thinking about him. And then do
    something fun to take your mind off of worrying. He may just be busy and
    I'm sure he's missing you. <em>[don't tell people what to
    do.]</em></p>
